We introduce a Web-Based Affectedness Indicator (WAI), a general-purpose tool for\nreal-time monitoring of economic disruptions across diverse contexts. By leveraging Large Language\nModel (LLM) assisted classification and information extraction on texts from over five million com-\npany websites, WAI quantifies the degree and nature of firms’ responses to external shocks. Using the\nCOVID-19 pandemic as a specific application, we show that WAI is highly correlated with pandemic\ncontainment measures and reliably predicts firm performance. Unlike traditional data sources, WAI\nprovides timely firm-level information across industries and geographies worldwide that would oth-\nerwise be unavailable due to institutional and data availability constraints. This methodology offers\nsignificant potential for monitoring and mitigating the impact of technological, political, financial,\nhealth or environmental crises, and represents a transformative tool for adaptive policy-making and\neconomic resilience.\nKeywords: large language models, natural language processing, crisis, economic shocks, economic\nmonitoring, Covid-19\nEconomic shocks, whether driven by public health\ncrises, technological disruptions, geopolitical con-\nflicts, or climate events, pose significant challenges\nto businesses and policymakers alike. Timely and\naccurate monitoring of these shocks is critical for\ncrafting effective responses and enhancing eco-\nnomic resilience. However, traditional methods for\nmeasuring the impacts of such disruptions – such\nas surveys and administrative data – are often\nlimited by costs, time lags, and coverage.\nIn this study, we introduce the Web-Based\nAffectedness Indicator (WAI), a scalable and cost-\neffective tool for real-time monitoring of economic\ndisruptions at the firm level. By analyzing tex-\ntual data from millions of company websites,\nWAI provides granular insights into how firms\nexperience and respond to external shocks. This\n1\n\nmethodology overcomes traditional limitations by\nleveraging ubiquitous online content and state-of-\nthe-art natural language processing (NLP) models\nto generate a dynamic and comprehensive view of\neconomic affectedness.\nWhile the Covid-19 pandemic1–3 serves as\na prominent example to illustrate WAI’s capa-\nbilities, the method’s applicability extends far\nbeyond public health crises. WAI can provide\ninformation on a wide range of challenges, in-\ncluding supply chain disruptions, financial crises,\nand climate-related shocks. By offering real-time,\nhigh-resolution insights, it provides a transfor-\nmative tool for policymakers, businesses, and re-\nsearchers seeking to understand and mitigate the\nimpacts of global disruptions.\nOur novel method substantially improves on\nexisting approaches in the literature. Several sur-\nveys have been conducted to analyze how firms\nhave been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.4–9\nIn addition, there exist several survey-based stud-\nies investigating the relationship between pro-\nductivity and firm resilience during the Covid-19\ncrisis.10–13 As an alternative to survey data, ad-\nministrative or accounting data can be used to\nanalyze the economic impact of the Covid-19 cri-\nsis.14,15 Various studies further analyze the effec-\ntiveness of Covid-19 policy support measures.16,17\nThe above mentioned data sources are undeniably\nvaluable. However, they come with some limi-\ntations. Surveys, for example, can be expensive\nto conduct and can suffer from low participation\nrates, particularly during periods of a crisis. Ac-\ncounting data, at the firm or national level, might\nbe diﬀicult to access, have only partial coverage,\nand typically becomes available only with a signif-\nicant delay. Our study aims at overcoming these\nlimitations and adds to an emerging body of lit-\nerature that uses “text as data”18,19 to examine\nthe economic repercussions of the Covid-19 crisis,\nwhile broadening the existing literature that has\nbeen limited to a single country or publicly listed\nfirms.20–26 Notably, sample sizes in the above\nmentioned studies typically range in a few thou-\nsand companies, while we cover over 5 million\npublic and private companies.\nThe WAI workflow is illustrated in Figure 1\n(see Methods for further details). Our content\nextraction process involves downloading and ana-\nlyzing company websites from the internet archive\nCommonCrawl, and identifying paragraphs men-\ntioning Covid-related keywords.1 Using a large\nlanguage model (Llama 3.1) through a simple\nfew-shot prompt method,27 we then classify the\nseverity of impact on firms by scoring the af-\nfectedness and tagging specific aspects such as\nfacility closures or supply chain issues. By analyz-\ning multiple crawls of the same company’s website\nin combination with location and industry infor-\nmation, we are able to track changes over time\nand analyze firm-level impacts across sectors and\nspace.\nWhile almost all firms maintain a website\nnowadays, it is not obvious that the content on\na website can be used as an economic shock in-\ndicator. To validate WAI as a real-time economic\nshock monitoring tool, we compare it with (i)\nalternative measures for Covid-19 policy inter-\nventions that are only available at the aggregate\n(state or country) level and (ii) firm performance\nmeasures from balance sheet data (sales growth or\nstock market valuations) for a subset of publicly\nlisted firms.2\nFor our validation exercise, we first consider\nCovid-19 pandemic policy responses in the US and\nEurope. Figure 2 shows the economic affectedness\nfrom Covid-19 across the US and the four largest\nstates within the US (California, Florida, Texas\nand New York). Figure 3 shows the affectedness\nin Europe and among major European economies\n(United Kingdom, Germany, France and Spain).\nBoth figures show the share of companies with\nthe highest level of impact according to WAI (a\nscore of 3 on a scale from 0 to 3) for each country\nand crawl. As an alternative affectedness mea-\nsure, that is available at this level of aggregation\n(but not at the firm-level), the figures also show\nthe government response stringency index3 of the\nOxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker\n(OxCGRT).28 Moreover, the number of analyzed\n1See SI Appendix A.2 for a complete list of keywords and\nlanguages considered.\n2We also compared WAI with the proportion of Covid-\nrelated keywords in all the words of the “risk assessments” in\nthe business reports (10-K reports) of publicly listed firms in\nthe US, 21 and find a significant positive correlation (with a\ncorrelation coeﬀicient of 0.427).\n3The stringency index aggregates information from school\nclosures, workplace closures, cancellation of public events, re-\nstrictions on public gatherings, closures of public transport,\nstay-at-home requirements, public information campaigns, re-\nstrictions on internal movements, and international travel\ncontrols. A higher score indicates a stricter response, with a\nminimum of 0 and a maximum of 100.\n2\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of the WAI workflow (see Methods). We extract content from company websites\nin CommonCrawl, classify Covid-19 impact using a large language model, and track changes over time\nto analyze firm-level impacts across sectors and different geographies.\nfirms, and the Pearson correlation coeﬀicient be-\ntween WAI and OxCGRT (of the first differences\nof the two times series) are shown. The figures\nillustrate a strong correlation between the two\nmeasures. This shows that when aggregating WAI\nat the state level it can accurately measure the\neconomic shock stemming from Covid-19 policy\ninterventions.4\nComparing the OxCGRT stringency index\nwith WAI in Figures 2 and 3, respectively, we\nsee that in the early stages of the pandemic, the\nstringency index shows a steeper increase than\nWAI and that WAI starts to increase only with a\nsmall time lag after the stringency index. This re-\nflects a delay in the companies’ affectedness from\nthe policy interventions possibly due to the ex-\nistence of inventory stocks or excess capacities\nthat allowed firms to absorb temporarily the im-\npact of the shock. Moreover, disruptions in the\ncompanies’ operations might only surface with a\ndelay, or firms might initially have anticipated\nthat the polices would only be in place for a\n4A complete overview of all US states and other countries\nconsidered in our data sample can be found in SI Appendices\nB.1 and B.2, respectively.\nshort time period. However, as policy interven-\ntions persisted over time, WAI and stringency\nindex become more closely aligned. In particular,\nas more drastic measures such as workplace clo-\nsures and stay-at-home requirements were lifted,\nWAI reacts almost instantaneously by showing\nlower levels of affectedness.\nTo further evaluate the relevance of WAI for\nindividual firm performance we run a panel re-\ngression with quarterly sales growth (in %) and\nstock market valuations as dependent variables\nusing WAI intensity levels of Covid-19 impact –\nranging from mild, to moderate and severely af-\nfected5 – as predictors with various controls (see\nMethods). The estimation results are shown in\nFigure 4 for the sample periods 2017 to 2022 with\nquarterly balance sheet data for around 30 thou-\nsand publicly listed firms (from S&P’s Compustat\nNorth America and Global). In the simplest spec-\nification, we include firm-level fixed effects, which\ncapture factors such as a firm’s propensity to use\nits website to communicate its exposure to ex-\nternal shocks, and quarterly time fixed effects,\n5The group of unaffected or positively affected companies\nserves as the reference category.\n3\n\nFigure 2: Left panels show the WAI (share of severely affected firms) and OxCGRT government response\nstringency index in the US and the four largest states within the US (California, Florida, Texas and\nNew York) together with the number of analyzed firms (n), and the Pearson correlation coeﬀicient (r)\nbetween the first differences (over time) of WAI and OxCGRT. Time periods in which workplace closing\nor stay at home requirements were implemented are indicated with vertical bars. Right, spatial maps\nindicating WAI share of severely affected firms at the city level, with the size of each city proportional\nto the count of analyzed firms in it.\nwhich capture firm-invariant time trends such as\nthe cross-regional temporal evolution of the pan-\ndemic. The estimated coeﬀicients shown in the\nleft panel in Figure 4 can be interpreted as fol-\nlows: Companies that were only slightly affected\nby Covid-19 did not suffer any significant sales\ngrowth losses. By contrast, moderately affected\ncompanies recorded a significant 12.1% decrease\nin sales growth (annualized) compared to not or\npositively affected companies. Severely affected\ncompanies show a slightly higher sales growth loss\nof around 15%. In an extended specification we\ninclude additional controls for government poli-\ncies as well as the epidemiological development\nmeasured by the number of people who died from\nCovid-19 in a country per month. Finally, we\ninclude country-industry-quarter-specific fixed ef-\nfects. This does not only absorb all additional\ncontrols in the previous specification but also\nunobserved heterogeneity in policies and the de-\nvelopment of the pandemic in each country. This\nleads to slightly smaller marginal effects. Slightly\naffected firms have 7.8% lower annualized sales\ngrowth than unaffected or positively affected com-\npanies and severely affected firms experienced\n11.7% lower sales growth in this most stringent\nestimate.\nIn the estimates for stock returns (shown in\nthe right panel in Figure 4), we see in the strictest\nestimation model (with full fixed effects) that\neven slightly affected companies show significantly\nlower stock returns of annualized 3% compared to\ncompanies that are not affected or are positively\naffected. As expected, moderately affected com-\npanies and severely affected companies show even\n4\n\nFigure 3:\nCovid-19 affectedness based on WAI and OxCGRT government response stringency index\nin Europe and four European economies (United Kingdom, Germany, France and Spain). OxCGRT\nstringency for Europe was constructed as an (unweighted) average of the stringency in all European\ncountries.\nstronger losses. They amount to 3.3% for mod-\nerately affected companies and 4.4% for severely\naffected companies.6\nThe above discussion demonstrates that WAI\naccurately predicts a firm’s sales growth and stock\nreturns across all specifications. This confirms\nthat WAI delivers timely, firm-level insights into\nexposure and its associated performance effects\n– insights that go beyond what can be inferred\nfrom monitoring government policies or epidemi-\nological trends alone. The indicator is also precise\nenough to distinguish the effects even in terms of\nthe severity of affectedness. Our results thus align\nwith previous studies showing that returns on as-\nsets14 or aggregate GDP growth15 deteriorated\nduring the Covid-19 pandemic.\nAdditional\nrobustness\nchecks\nfor\ndifferent\nLLMs, time horizons, sectors and specifications\n6The detailed estimation results for quarterly sales growth\nand quarterly stock returns can be found in Table C.1 in the\nsupplementary information (SI) Appendix C.1.\nFigure 4: Estimation results for sales growth and\nstock returns over the periods 2017-2022 (see Eqs.\n(1) to (3) in Methods, and SI Appendix C.1 for\nfurther details). The full set of estimation results\ncan be found in SI Appendix Table C.1.\n5\n\ncan be found in SI Appendix C.2. In SI Appendix\nC.2.1 we use an alternative LLM (ChatGPT) to\ncompute WAIs and find that the estimates show\na high degree of similarity. In SI Appendix C.2.2\nwe estimate the model for different time periods\nand find that the coeﬀicients for the WAIs tend\nto be higher but less precisely measured when we\nconsider a shorter sample period from 2018 to\n2021, or from 2019 to 2020. In SI Appendix C.2.3\nwe estimate the model for the manufacturing and\nservices sectors separately. We find that the esti-\nmated coeﬀicients for sales growth are higher in\nthe manufacturing sector than in the services sec-\ntor. This result is consistent with the fact that\nthe manufacturing sector is particularly vulner-\nable to supply chain shocks due to its reliance\non complex, global supply chains and just-in-time\ninventory systems, and that supply chains being\nidentified as the most significant issue mentioned\nby firms on their websites (see Figure 5). Finally,\nin SI Appendix C.2.4 we estimate a model that in-\ncludes a one-period lag of the dependent variable\nto account for potential serial correlation. We find\nthat our baseline estimates remain robust under\nthis alternative specification.\nAfter having provided evidence for the valid-\nity of WAI we can now analyze its output more\nclosely. First, we can use the LLM to assign tags\nindicating the type of problems firms were experi-\nencing during the Covid-19 pandemic. These tags\nare shown in Figure 5 across countries. The three\nmost prominent tags were related to supply chain\nissues followed by closure and hygiene measures\n(such as quarantine or social distance; see Meth-\nods). Moreover, up to 60% of the firms reported\nsupply chain problems in the US, Canada and the\nUK. This resonates with results from recent sur-\nveys among small-to-medium sized businesses,29\nbut covers a much broader range of firms.\nSecond, we can analyze which sectors were\naffected the most from the Covid-19 pandemic.\nFigure 6 shows a ranking of the most affected sec-\ntors, based on the WAI share of severely affected\nfirms by industry, where each firm is weighted by\nits number of employees. This measures can be\ninterpreted as the share of employees working in\nseverely affected firms in each industry. We find\nthat the most affected sectors were ’Accommoda-\ntion’ (42%), followed by ’Arts, Entertainment and\nRecreation and Human Health’ (40%), and ’Social\nFigure 5:\nTags assigned by the LLM for how\nfirms were affected, aggregated by country (see\nMethods).\nWork Activities’ (39%). The least affected sectors\nwere ’Energy Utilities (19%), ’Wholesale Trade’\n(10%) and ’Construction’ (7%). This is broadly\nin line with previous studies based on risk assess-\nments of publicly listed firms in the US,20,21 but\nour analysis covers not only public but also private\nfirms.\nThis paper presents a novel method for assess-\ning the economic impact of social and economic\nshocks on firms using web-based data. By an-\nalyzing over five million company websites, we\ndevelop WAI and use it to measure the firm-level\nimpact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The reliability\nof WAI is demonstrated through its strong corre-\nlation with pandemic containment measures and\nits ability to accurately capture the impact on\nbusiness performance.\nUnlike traditional data collection methods, our\nweb-based indicator is not only comprehensive\nand reliable but provides also real-time informa-\ntion, as many companies immediately report the\nimpact of shocks on their websites to inform their\ncustomers or other relevant parties. Real-time in-\nformation shortens the trial-and-error phase of\n6\n\nFigure 6: The share of severely affected firms by\nindustry (see Methods).\npolicy formulation, improving the accuracy of\nresponses and safeguarding public budgets.\nA cross-country comparison suggests that\nWAI performs most effectively in countries with\nwidespread internet usage and a predominantly\nEnglish-speaking population, such as the US,\nCanada, the UK, and Ireland (cf. SI Appendix\nB.2). This limitation could be attributed to the\nfact that the LLMs employed in this study are\nprimarily trained on English-language corpora,\nwhich may give them an advantage in these coun-\ntries. However, with an increasing digitization\nacross countries world-wide and improvements in\nmulti-lingual LLMs we expect these differences to\nbecome less prominent over time, and thus making\nWAI an even more valuable tool in the future.\nThe findings of this study mark a signifi-\ncant advancement in real-time economic mon-\nitoring\nat\nthe\ncompany\nlevel,\noffering\nvalu-\nable insights for policy-making. This capabil-\nity is essential for enhancing the resilience of\neconomies to future global shocks, whether they\nare health-related, technological, political, finan-\ncial, or climate-driven (e.g., “Disease X”30, tariffs,\nescalating trade wars, etc.).\nReferences\n[1] Pangallo, M. et al.\nThe unequal effects of the\nhealth–economy trade-off during the COVID-\n19 pandemic.\nNature Human Behaviour 1–12\n(2023).\n[2] Hsiang, S. et al.

We\nuse information from over five million company\nwebsites worldwide to determine whether the pan-\ndemic caused economic disruptions at the firm-\nlevel. To measure the impact of the pandemic on\nfirm performance, we use sales information from\nS&P’s Compustat North America and Global fi-\nnancials databases. Information on government\ninterventions is taken from the Oxford Covid-19\nGovernment Response Tracker (OxCGRT).28 In\nthe following, we describe these datasets in more\ndetail, demonstrate how we analyze company web-\nsites and what estimation techniques are used to\nrelate the development of company performance\nto the Covid-19 exposure.\nHistorical company website information.\nWe use the CommonCrawl dataset to access his-\ntorical information from company websites. Com-\nmonCrawl is an extensive and constantly updated\ncollection of web data that covers a large part of\nthe web content and allows access to the historical\ncontent of a website. This makes it possible to fol-\nlow the development of website content over time.\nCommonCrawl is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and all its\ndata is open source.7 The data is organized into\ncrawl snapshots each containing around 30 mil-\nlion domains and 3 billion URLs.8 The crawls are\ndone at a close-to-monthly frequency. For the pe-\nriod of concern, January 2020 to December 2022,\nthe available crawls are listed in Extended Data\nTable 1.\nInformation about the crawling process, se-\nlection of seed URLs, crawling frequency, and\npoliteness policies9 can be found on the Com-\nmonCrawl website. We built a tool to download\n7https://github.com/commoncrawl\n8https://commoncrawl.github.io/cc-crawl-statistics\n9In particular the crawling respects the robot.txt of the\naccessed websites.\n8\n\nand process the historical website information.\nThe tool is published open source on a GitHub\nwebsite.10\nWe start our analysis with a list of com-\npany website domains from Bureau Van Dijk’s\nOrbis database, which is a comprehensive and\nwidely used source of public and private com-\npany data.31 We restrict our selection to com-\npanies in the database with a website address,\nlocation information, and at least 5 employees.\nThis yields 8,164,172 unique domains.11 Of these,\n5,592,178 can be found in CommonCrawl.12 A\nwebsite not being indexed by CommonCrawl can\nhave multiple reasons, such as the website be-\ning unreachable/unmaintained, the administrator\nnot allowing crawls of the website, or the website\nsimply not being linked to any other part of the in-\nternet so that the crawler cannot find it. Note that\ndomains that are part of a crawl in e.g. January\nare not always part of the next crawl in February.\nHowever, the domain overlap between crawls – as\nmeasured by the Jaccard similarity shown in Ex-\ntended Data Figure 7 – is high, indicating that we\ncan follow the same firms over multiple observa-\ntion periods. We also construct a measure for the\ncontent overlap of a firm’s website between crawls.\nCommonCrawl assigns unique so-called ’content\ndigest’ IDs to identify (exactly) duplicate captures\nof a website. For each firm, we calculate a ’content\ndigest heartbeat’, which is the share of crawls be-\ntween which the content on the firm’s website has\nchanged. For instance, a value of 0.75 means that\nthe content has changed between 18 out of the 24\ntotal analyzed crawls. On average, firms change\ntheir website content often: the median firm has\na heartbeat of 0.97 (the full distribution is shown\nin Extended Data Figure 8).\nFor each of the domains we have information\nfor in CommonCrawl, we download all subpages\n(such as apple.com/home, apple.com/newsroom)\navailable, up to a total of 50. If there are\nmore than 50 subpages available, we select the\n50 shortest URLs - these subpages will be\nhigher up in the sitemap and therefore contain\n10https://github.com/jakob-ra/cc-download\n11An overview of the countries covered can be found in SI\nAppendix A.1.\n12Note that for some companies we have multiple websites:\nThe 5,592,178 unique domains correspond to 5,429,830 unique\nfirms.

In addi-\ntion, we select all URLs that contain one of\nthe Covid-19 keywords in any language (such as\naholddelhaize.com/covid-19). In most cases,\nwe find relevant information on either subpages\nwith keyword-containing URLs, the landing page,\nor a ’/news’ or similarly titled subpage. There-\nfore, we would not expect significant performance\nbenefits from increasing the number of analyzed\nshortest subpages beyond 50. In the next step,\nwe parse the HTML code of each website and\nextract paragraphs containing at least one of a\nlist of Covid-related keywords, translated into 65\nlanguages.13 The paragraphs are then processed\nusing Llama 3.1, an open-source large language\nmodel (LLM) developed by Meta AI. At the time\nof this writing, the model is at the accuracy-\neﬀiciency frontier among open-source LLMs.14 To\nspeed up processing, we use 8-bit floating point\nquantization which leads only to a minimal loss\nof quality. We use a custom logits processor that\nforces the model to return outputs in proper JSON\nformat along with the following parameters: a\ntemperature setting of 0 (because we want the\nmodel to choose the likeliest outputs in terms of\naffectedness and tags and not be creative), 64\nmaximum output tokens (which is more than suf-\nficient to assign multiple tags if required), a fixed\nseed and stop characters ’0’ and ’}’, meaning the\nLLM will stop generating after either affectedness\nis detected as 0 or reaching the end of proper\nJSON output. We use the few-shot prompt shown\nin Extended Data Figure 9,15 in which we insert\nthe Covid-mentioning paragraph as ’<Input para-\ngraph>’. The LLM returns a number between 0\nand 3 indicating the severity of affectedness, as\nwell as a list of tags indicating how the firm was\naffected. For most firms that do mention Covid,\nthere are multiple text passages (often also from\ndifferent subpages) that contain Covid keywords.\n13This was done using the following prompt for the large lan-\nguage model GPT-3.5-turbo: Translate the following keywords\ninto: ’corona’, ’covid’, ’covid-19’, ’sars-cov-2’, ’coronavirus’,\n’pandemic’ Please only output the translated keywords, each\non a new line. The resulting keywords can be found in SI\nAppendix A.2.\n14For comparison, we also repeat the analysis with OpenAI’s\nclosed-source GPT-4o mini model and find that our approach\nmatches or exceeds its quality. The results can be found in SI\nAppendix Table C.2.\n15Few shot prompting has been shown to lead to compara-\nble performance to fine-tuning, 27 especially for less complex\ninformation extraction tasks like the one considered here. 32\n9\n\nThe severity value for the firm for one time period\nis the maximum over all text passages mentioning\nCovid, and the tags are the union of tags assigned\nto all passages.\nTag construction. In the prompt we instructed\nthe LLM to assign tags describing specific ways\na firm was affected by Covid-19. We have sum-\nmarized the tags identified by the LLM under\nthe following umbrella terms: Supply chain issues,\nclosure, remote work, hygiene measures, travel\nrestrictions and financial impact. The individual\ntags proposed by the LLM that fall under these\numbrella terms can be found in Extended Data\nFigure 10.\nCompany\nperformance\ninformation. Our\nstudy encompasses data from S&P’s Compustat\nNorth America database, which includes 43,963\npublicly listed US firms, and the Compustat\nGlobal database, covering 14,076 publicly listed\nnon-US firms, for the years 2017 to 2022, using\nconsolidated accounts. We conducted an in-depth\nanalysis of quarterly financials, focusing on sales,\nnumber of employees, and total assets. To mea-\nsure the financial performance across quarters, we\ncalculated quarter-to-quarter growth rates after\nconverting all financial levels to USD, utilizing\ncurrency exchange rates from Yahoo Finance. Ad-\nditionally, we examined stock returns on the last\nday of each quarter, making adjustments for stock\nsplits and applying the total return factor. For a\ncomprehensive overview, we categorized the data\nby city, country, and industry, converting NAICS\ndata to the NACE classification using established\ncorrespondence tables.16\nCovid-19 policy measures. Information on pol-\nicy interventions in response to the Covid-19\npandemic is obtained from the Oxford Covid-19\nGovernment Response Tracker (OxCGRT).28\nEconometric Analysis\nWe collected historic websites for 42,644 out\nof 52,245 companies listed in Compustat North\nAmerica and Global through CommonCrawl, cov-\nering 81.6% of the companies. This aligns with\n16https://www.census.gov/naics/concordances/2017_\nNAICS_to_ISIC_4.xlsx)\nprevious research findings on CommonCrawl’s\nrepresentativeness.17\nThe benchmark model used to analyze how our\nindicators track firm performance is expressed as:\n∆log yi,t = log yi,t −log yi,t−1\n= α + δi + δt + Z′\ni,t−1v + βCovid mentioni,t\n+ γ1Mildly affectedi,t + γ2Moderately affectedi,t\n+ γ3Severely affectedi,t + ϵi,t\n(1)\nwhere yi,t denotes either sales or stock price\nfor firm i in quarter t. The dependent variable\n∆log yi,t is either log sales growth or log stock re-\nturns. The coeﬀicient δi denotes a firm fixed effect,\nδt are quarter fixed effects, Zi,t−1 are time-varying\nfirm characteristics (log total assets), and ϵi,t is an\nerror term. The dependent variable is transformed\ninto a percentage so that the estimated coeﬀicients\ncan be more easily interpreted. ‘Covid mention’ is\na dummy for whether a company mentions Covid-\n19 on its websites, and the affectedness severity\n(ranging from ‘Mildly affected’, ‘Moderately af-\nfected’ to ‘Severely affected’) stems from the LLM\noutput.\nWe also estimate a model with additional con-\ntrols for government policies and the development\nof the pandemic:\n∆log yi,t = α + δi + δt + W ′\nc,tu + Z′\ni,t−1v + βCovid mentioni,t\n+ γ1Mildly affectedi,t + γ2Moderately affectedi,t\n+ γ3Severely affectedi,t + ϵi,t\n(2)\nwhere Wc,t are variables relating to government\npolicies18 and epidemiological variables in country\nc and quarter t. Finally, we estimate a model with\nfull fixed effects as follows:\n∆log yi,t = α + δi + δs,c,t + Z′\ni,t−1v + βCovid mentioni,t\n+ γ1Mildly affectedi,t + γ2Moderately affectedi,t\n+ γ3Severely affectedi,t + ϵi,t\n(3)\nwhere δs,c,t are sector-country-quarter (index by\ns, c, t, respectively) fixed effects, sector/industry\nbeing measured at the NACE 2-digit level.

For the US we cover 95% of\nfirms with at least 5 employees, and typically at least half of such firms in EU countries. For countries\noutside of the OECD precise numbers on the total population of such companies is harder to obtain.\nWe therefore also show in Table A.1 the number of firms analyzed per million inhabitants. We exclude\ncountries with insuﬀicient coverage in our data, either less than 1,000 analyzed firms per million inhabi-\ntants or less than 20 percent of firms covered. Note that the number of analyzed firms in each country\nin our data sample depends on the number of firms with employee, sector, and website data available in\nthe Orbis database,31 as well as the number of websites available for these firms in CommonCrawl.\nThe comprehensiveness and global coverage of WAI is illustrated in Figure A.1, which depicts the\nshare of firms mentioning Covid-19 on their website across cities worldwide. The figure aggregates WAI\nscores at the city level, calculating the fraction of affected firms relative to the total number of firms in\neach location. Approximately 25% of all firms analyzed mention Covid-19 on their websites, with the\nlargest cities in North America, Europe, East Asia, and South America showing up to 40% of firms\nreferencing the pandemic. The figure highlights the extensive coverage of WAI, encompassing the major\neconomies of the developed world.\nFigure A.1:\nThe share of firms mentioning Covid-19 on their website at the city level, based on a\nsample of 5,429,830 companies with at least 5 employees.\n2\n\nTable A.1: Firm sample country coverage.\nFirms an-\nalyzed\nFirms\nan-\nalyzed per\nmillion in-\nhabitants\nTotal\nfirms\n(ex-\ncluding\n<5\nem-\nployees)\nShare\nof\nfirms\nanalyzed\n(%)\nSource of firm demograph-\nics data\nShare of pop-\nulation using\ninternet\n(%,\nOECD 2019)\nCountry\nUnited\nStates\nof\nAmerica\n2,193,914\n6,736\n2,312,130\n95\nU.S. Census Bureau (2020)\n89\nUnited Kingdom\n381,326\n5,776\n557,370\n68\nUK\nStatistics\nAuthority\n(2020)\n93\nGermany\n376,714\n4,555\n610,070†\n62\nOECD (2020)\n88\nRussian Federation\n261,519\n1,815\nFederal\nState\nStatistics\nService (2015)\n83\nBrazil\n246,810\n1,179\n794,990†\n31\nOECD (2020)\n74\nJapan\n199,468\n1,567\n1,204,730*\n17\nStatistical Oﬀice of Japan\n(2014)\n93\nItaly\n194,751\n3,216\n372,347†\n52\nOECD (2020)\n68\nChina\n186,861\n135\nState\nAdministration\nfor\nMarket Regulation (2017)\n64\nPoland\n185,042\n4,873\n215,855†\n86\nOECD (2020)\n80\nSpain\n131,047\n2,814\n285,410†\n46\nOECD (2020)\n91\nNetherlands\n98,707\n5,827\n108,148†\n91\nOECD (2020)\n93\nFrance\n93,788\n1,397\n329,489†\n28\nOECD (2020)\n83\nCanada\n73,368\n1,999\n298,350†\n25\nOECD (2020)\n92\nSweden\n57,129\n5,674\n82,443†\n69\nOECD (2020)\n94\nCzech Republic\n49,810\n4,703\n69,147†\n72\nOECD (2020)\n81\nAustria\n49,165\n5,581\n75,819†\n65\nOECD (2020)\n88\nBelgium\n45,370\n3,990\n56,780†\n80\nOECD (2020)\n90\nPortugal\n39,320\n3,820\n94,966†\n41\nOECD (2020)\n75\nNorway\n38,118\n7,344\n49,016†\n78\nOECD (2020)\n98\nRepublic of Korea\n38,021\n745\n853,449\n4\nStatistics Korea (2019)\n96\nSwitzerland\n37,222\n4,494\n97,783†\n38\nOECD (2020)\n93\nDenmark\n35,950\n6,276\n44,388†\n81\nOECD (2020)\n98\nHungary\n34,563\n3,534\n62,473†\n55\nOECD (2020)\n80\nFinland\n30,610\n5,570\n39,779†\n77\nOECD (2020)\n90\nRomania\n27,151\n1,386\n104,468†\n26\nOECD (2020)\n74\nVietnam\n27,023\n289\n138,478*\n20\nStatistical\nYearbook\nof\nVietnam 2016 (2015)\n69\nMexico\n25,975\n212\n516,720†\n5\nOECD (2020)\n70\nLithuania\n21,974\n7,771\n27,179†\n81\nOECD (2020)\n82\nBulgaria\n20,864\n2,949\n48,423†\n43\nOECD (2020)\n68\nSlovakia\n19,528\n3,596\n30,634†\n64\nOECD (2020)\n83\nIreland\n17,683\n3,719\n39,456†\n45\nOECD (2020)\n87\nUkraine\n17,421\n389\n60,154*\n29\nState\nStatistics\nService\nUkraine (2017)\n70\nGreece\n15,815\n1,470\n79,868†\n20\nOECD (2020)\n76\nCroatia\n12,753\n3,091\n29,667†\n43\nOECD (2020)\n79\nTurkey\n12,672\n157\n347,210†\n4\nOECD (2020)\n74\nSerbia\n12,536\n1,750\n11,403*\n110\nOECD (2013)\n77\nLatvia\n9,686\n4,991\n18,023†\n54\nOECD (2020)\n86\nSlovenia\n9,577\n4,634\n16,556†\n58\nOECD (2020)\n83\nEstonia\n9,410\n7,143\n14,095†\n67\nOECD (2020)\n90\nIsrael\n8,892\n1,040\n66,367†\n13\nOECD (2020)\n87\nPeru\n6,363\n198\n85,672*\n7\nMinisterio de la Produc-\ncion (2016)\n60\nAustralia\n5,490\n223\n249,812\n2\nAustralian\nBureau\nof\nStatistics.

In particular, in Section B.1\nwe show the Covid-19 affectedness based on WAI and OxCGRT among the fifty largest states in the US,\nwhile in Section B.2 we provide an international comparison.\nB.1 Variation Across US States\nFigure B.1 shows the share of firms mentioning Covid-19 and the severity of affectedness by US states.\nFor each firm, we take the maximum degree of affectedness over the period of analysis. The most affected\nstates are the District of Columbia, Vermont and Maine, while the least affected states are Florida, Utah\nand Georgia. Similar to Figure 2 in the main text, we can analyze variations of affectedness also over\ntime and space. Figures B.2, B.3 and B.4 show the Covid-19 affectedness based on WAI and OxCGRT\namong US states (in terms of the number of companies analyzed) together with the number of analyzed\nfirms, and the Pearson correlation coeﬀicient (r) between WAI and OxCGRT (in the first differences of\nthe two time series). For almost all states the correlation coeﬀicient, r, between WAI and OxCGRT is\nabove 0.8, indicating that at the aggregate state level both measures are highly correlated. The spatial\nmaps show that the population centers in each state exhibit the largest fractions of affected firms.\n7\n\nFigure B.1: Share of firms mentioning Covid on their website, as well as the intensity of affectedness\nbased on company websites for US states.\n8\n\nFigure B.2: Left panels show Covid-19 affectedness based on WAI and OxCGRT among the twenty\nlargest states in the US (in terms of the number of companies analyzed) together with the number\nof analyzed firms (n), and the Pearson correlation coeﬀicient (r) between WAI and OxCGRT (first\ndifferences).

Right, spatial maps indicating WAI at the city level.\n11\n\nB.2 International Comparison\nIn this section we provide a comparison of WAI across countries. For this purpose we only consider\ncountries where the share of the population using the internet is above the EU average (of 82.76%) in\nthe year 2019 using data from the International Telecommunication Union.33 The motivation for this\nthreshold is that websites are expected to be used by firms as an effective communication tool (which is\na prerequisite for WAI) only if the internet usage in the population is suﬀiciently high.19\nFigure B.5 shows the share of firms mentioning Covid-19 together with each affectedness category\nacross countries. For each firm analyzed we take the maximum degree of affectedness over the period of\nanalysis. We see strong differences across countries, with strongly affected countries including the UK,\nCanada, Belgium, and less affected countries including Nordic and Eastern European countries such as\nLatvia, Estonia or Finland. Moreover, similar to Figure 3 in the main text, we can analyze variations\nof affectedness also over time and space. Figure B.6 shows Covid-19 affectedness based on WAI and\nOxCGRT among the largest countries (in terms of the number of companies analyzed) together with\nthe number of analyzed firms, and the Pearson correlation coeﬀicient between WAI and OxCGRT (of\nthe first differences of the two time series). Figure B.6 shows that for almost all countries analyzed the\ncorrelation coeﬀicient between WAI and OxCGRT is above 0.56, indicating that at the aggregate country\nlevel both measures are highly correlated. The spatial maps show that the population centers in each\ncountry exhibit the largest fractions of affected firms.\nWe note that the correlation is slightly lower than what we have observed for the US states in the\nprevious Section B.1. The cross-country comparison seems to suggests that WAI performs best in coun-\ntries with widespread internet usage (cf. Table A.1) and a predominantly English-speaking population,\nsuch as the US, Canada, the UK, and Ireland. A possible explanation could be that the LLMs examined\nin this study are primarily trained on English-language corpora, which may give them an advantage in\nthese countries. However, with increasing digitization across countries and improvements in multi-lingual\nLLMs we expect these differences to become less prominent over time, and thus making WAI an even\nmore valuable tool in the future.\n19The complete set of all countries can be accessed via the public dashboard available at: https://covid-explorer.kof.ethz.ch/.\n12\n\nFigure B.5: Share of firms mentioning Covid-19 on their website, as well as the intensity of affectedness\nbased on website text for the top 50 countries by number of analyzed firms. We only consider countries\nwhere the share of the population using the internet is above the EU average in the year 2019.\n13\n\nFigure B.6: Left panels show Covid-19 affectedness based on WAI and OxCGRT among the largest\ncountries (in terms of the number of companies analyzed) together with the number of analyzed firms (n),\nand the Pearson correlation coeﬀicient (r) between WAI and OxCGRT. Time periods in which workplace\nclosing or stay at home requirements were implemented are indicated with vertical bars. Right, spatial\nmaps indicating WAI at the city level. We only consider countries where the share of the population\nusing the internet is above the EU average in the year 2019.\n14\n\nC Supplementary Notes: Estimation and robustness\nIn the following sections we present the details of the estimation results shown in Figure 4 in the main text\nand provide additional robustness checks for different LLMs, time horizons, sectors and specifications.\nSpecifically, Section C.1 shows the estimation results across the different specifications in Eqs. (1), (2) and\n(3). Next, Section C.2 presents several robustness checks, where in Section C.2.1 we use an alternative\nLLM (ChatGPT) to compute WAIs, in Section C.2.2 we estimate the model for different time periods,\nin Section C.2.3 we estimate the model for the manufacturing and services sectors separately, and in\nSection C.2.4 we estimate a model that includes a one-period lag of the dependent variable to account\nfor potential serial correlation.\nC.1 Estimation Results\nTable C.1 presents the complete set of estimation results for Eqs. (1) to (3), using quarterly sales growth\n(in percentages) in columns (1) to (3), and stock returns (in percentages) in columns (4) to (6) as the\ndependent variables, covering the period from 2017 to 2022. The independent variables include the WAI\nCovid-19 affectedness categories based on the LLM. A graphical illustration of annualized coeﬀicients\nfrom these estimates is provided in Figure 4 in the main text.\nIn particular, in columns (1) and (4) in Table C.1 correspond to the estimation Equation (1) with the\nCovid-19 mentions and the WAI Covid-19 affectedness categories – mild, moderate, and severe – based\non the Llama 3.1 LLM output as explanatory variables. Columns (2) and (5) in Table C.1 correspond to\nthe estimation Equation (2) with additional controls from OxCGRT. The controls included are workplace\nclosing recommended or required for all-but-essential sectors, stay at home recommended or required\nwith minimal exceptions, log fiscal measures, and the number of deaths from Covid-19 per million. As\nexpected, these policy measures have negative signs for sales growth, except for fiscal measures which are\nassisting companies directly or indirectly. However, we find that the estimated coeﬀicient changes sign\nwhen analyzing stock returns. This could be explained by the fact that stock prices reflect expectations\nfor future earnings, if investors believe that taking such measures has long-term benefits that outweigh\nshort-term damages. Columns (3) and (6) in Table C.1 correspond to the estimation Equation (3) where\ninstead of the OxCGRT policy controls we include country-industry-quarter fixed effects.

Moreover, estimating fixed effects in dynamic panel data in the “small T, large\nN” context with a lagged dependent variable as covariate can introduce a “Nickell bias”.34 Since T is 24\nperiods in the main estimates, the upper limits for this possible bias are small, Nickell shows that they\nare approximately −(1 + βlagged dep.)/(T −1) which in our case equals roughly −0.06 for sales growth and\n−0.05 for stock returns.\n23\n\nTable C.7: Regression results with one lag of the dependent variable.\nLog sales growth (%)\nLog stock returns (%)\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\nLagged dependent\n-0.306∗∗∗\n-0.306∗∗∗\n-0.310∗∗∗\n-0.106∗∗∗\n-0.106∗∗∗\n-0.105∗∗∗\n(0.00783)\n(0.00786)\n(0.00849)\n(0.00482)\n(0.00486)\n(0.00503)\nCovid mention\n0.551\n0.736\n0.811\n-0.527∗∗∗\n-0.664∗∗∗\n-0.489∗∗\n(0.433)\n(0.436)\n(0.471)\n(0.160)\n(0.160)\n(0.165)\nAffected\nMild\n-1.240\n-1.172\n-0.347\n-0.716∗∗\n-0.810∗∗∗\n-0.747∗∗\n(0.728)\n(0.738)\n(0.936)\n(0.231)\n(0.232)\n(0.247)\nModerate\n-3.687∗∗∗\n-3.589∗∗∗\n-2.492∗∗\n-1.120∗∗∗\n-1.230∗∗∗\n-0.897∗∗∗\n(0.587)\n(0.609)\n(0.812)\n(0.229)\n(0.232)\n(0.257)\nSevere\n-4.769∗∗∗\n-4.684∗∗∗\n-3.486∗∗∗\n-1.444∗∗∗\n-1.622∗∗∗\n-1.292∗∗∗\n(0.797)\n(0.810)\n(1.012)\n(0.303)\n(0.304)\n(0.337)\nLagged log total\n-4.359∗∗∗\n-4.258∗∗∗\n-3.929∗∗∗\n-4.551∗∗∗\n-4.531∗∗∗\n-4.584∗∗∗\nassets\n(0.666)\n(0.666)\n(0.738)\n(0.453)\n(0.455)\n(0.205)\nWorkplace closing\nRecommended\n-5.067∗∗∗\n4.102∗∗∗\n(0.523)\n(0.182)\nRequired\n-6.767∗∗∗\n6.087∗∗∗\n(0.604)\n(0.210)\nStay at home requirements\nRecommended\n-3.240∗∗∗\n2.464∗∗∗\n(0.476)\n(0.165)\nRequired\n-2.157∗∗∗\n0.423∗\n(0.539)\n(0.200)\nLog fiscal\n0.121∗∗∗\n0.00423\nmeasures\n(0.0296)\n(0.00947)\nCovid deaths per\n0.0816\n-0.0927∗∗\nmonth\n(0.0983)\n(0.0353)\nFirm FE\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nQuarter FE\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nCountry-Industry-Quarter FE\nNo\nNo\nYes\nNo\nNo\nYes\nNo. Firms\n32344\n32214\n30356\n32749\n32599\n31009\nObservations\n604794\n602564\n565409\n620058\n617651\n584005\nR2\n0.132\n0.132\n0.187\n0.129\n0.132\n0.310\nStandard errors in parentheses\nStandard errors clustered at the firm level\n∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001\n24\n",
