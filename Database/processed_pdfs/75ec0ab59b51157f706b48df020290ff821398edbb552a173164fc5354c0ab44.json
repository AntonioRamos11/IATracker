We find that the primary\nlimitation is the absence of long output exam-\nples during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). To\ntackle this issue, we introduce LongWriter-V-\n22k, a SFT dataset comprising 22,158 exam-\nples, each with multiple input images, an in-\nstruction, and corresponding outputs ranging\nfrom 0 to 10,000 words. Moreover, to achieve\nlong outputs that maintain high-fidelity to the\ninput images, we employ Direct Preference Op-\ntimization (DPO) to the SFT model. Given\nthe high cost of collecting human feedback for\nlengthy outputs (e.g., 3,000 words), we pro-\npose IterDPO, which breaks long outputs into\nsegments and uses iterative corrections to form\npreference pairs with the original outputs. Ad-\nditionally, we develop MMLongBench-Write,\na benchmark featuring six tasks to evaluate the\nlong-generation capabilities of VLMs. Our 7B\nparameter model, trained with LongWriter-V-\n22k and IterDPO, achieves impressive perfor-\nmance on this benchmark, outperforming larger\nproprietary models like GPT-4o.\n1\nIntroduction\nRecent advancements in Large Vision-Language\nModels (LVLMs) have significantly enhanced their\ncapabilities in processing visual and textual in-\nputs (Alayrac et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2024). No-\ntably, there have been substantial breakthroughs in\nthe long-context capabilities of VLMs (Xue et al.,\n2024; Shu et al., 2024).\nFor instance, Qwen2-\nVL (Wang et al., 2024a) can now understand videos\nup to 20 minutes, with a context window of 32k\ntokens. This progress has significantly expanded\nthe scope of tasks that VLMs can handle, making\nthem more applicable to real-world scenarios.\n*Equal contribution.\nHowever, despite the increased input context\nwindow, the effective output length of VLMs re-\nmains limited. To verify this limitation, we col-\nlect a benchmark comprising six tasks that require\nVLMs to generate long texts based on visual inputs\n(as shown in Figure 1). By adjusting the required\noutput length in the instructions, we found that all\nexisting models struggle to generate outputs ex-\nceeding 1,000 words (Section 2). In real-world sce-\nnarios, such long-output queries are common user\ndemands (Chou et al., 2024). For example, (1) cre-\native writing tasks may require generating detailed\nstories or essays based on visual prompts (Hong\net al., 2023), and (2) professional writing tasks may\ninvolve writing comprehensive reports or analyses\nfrom visual data (Hartsock and Rasool, 2024). To\nmeet these practical needs, it is essential to enhance\nthe long-output capabilities of VLMs.\nTo investigate the reasons behind the limited\nlong-output capability of VLMs, we are inspired\nby the LongWriter (Bai et al., 2024), which adjusts\nthe output length distribution of the supervised fine-\ntuning (SFT) data to observe changes in model\noutput length. Our experiments revealed that the\nproportion of long-output examples in the SFT data\ndetermines the model’s output length. This find-\ning explains why VLMs typically have an output\nlength limit of around 1,000 words. Existing vi-\nsual instruction tuning datasets (Schuhmann et al.,\n2022), such as LLaVA (Liu et al., 2024a), mainly\ncontain tasks like grounding (Liu et al., 2024b) and\ncaption generation (Wang et al., 2022), with most\noutputs being less than 300 words (Lin et al., 2014).\nTo fill the gap, we select long-output instruction-\nimage pairs from MMEvol (Luo et al., 2024) as\ninputs. In addition to single-image inputs, we also\nconstructed other forms of data, including multi-\nimage inputs and backtranslated instructions (Wang\net al., 2024b), to enrich the diversity of the input\ndata. To generate long outputs, we propose a plan-\nand-write approach: LongWriter-Agent-V. This\n1\narXiv:2502.14834v1  [cs.CV]  20 Feb 2025\n\nAnalyze the \nsequence of images \nin the provided \ncomic strip and \ngenerate a coherent \n2400-word story.\nAnalyze these two \nclassic scenes and \nwrite a 1300-word \nreview of this \nmovie.\nPlease write a \n1500-word social \nmedia post based \non the photos I \ntook in Paris.\n...\n...\nWrite a 2200-\nword lecture \nscript based on \nthese ppt \nimages.\nWrite a 1590-words \ndiagnostic report for a \npatient according to the \ntwo given x-ray \npictures.\n Write a 1600-words \ntravel guide for a 3-\ndays traveling \nexperience in the \nabove places. \n...\n...\nCreative Writing\nProfessional Writing\nMedical Report\nTravel Guide\nPPT Script\nScenery Copywriting\nMovie Review\nStory Generation\nFigure 1: Left: Six examples for each type of task in MMLongBench-Write. They are divided into two categories:\nprofessional writing and creative writing. The former requires professional knowledge, while the latter does not.\nRight: The joint distribution of the number of input images and the expected output length for data in both categories.\nMost data requires a 1000+ word output with given images, challenging the long-generation capabilities of VLMs.\nmethod involves providing input images and writ-\ning instructions to GPT-4o to first generate an out-\nline and then sequentially write the text in segments.\nThrough this approach, we collect LongWrite-V-\n22k, a dataset of 22k long-output examples.\nUsing LongWrite-V-22k for SFT, the output\nlength of Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct (Team, 2025)\ncan be extended beyond 3,000 words. However,\nlonger outputs often introduce issues such as rep-\netition and hallucination (Favero et al., 2024). To\nimprove the fidelity of long outputs, we adapted\nthe approach from RLHF-V (Yu et al., 2024a),\nwhere human experts revise the model’s outputs\nto form preference pairs for Direct Preference Op-\ntimization (DPO). Since traditional DPO (Rafailov\net al., 2024) is typically performed on short texts\nof around 300 words, and LongWriter-V’s output\nlength can exceed 3,000 words, the annotation cost\nis extremely high. To enhance the efficiency of\npreference data utilization, we proposed IterDPO,\nwhich divides long outputs into N segments, treat-\ning each segment’s revision as a preference pair.\nThis method allows the model to learn fine-grained\nhuman corrections for each segment and effectively\nmultiplies the use of a single long-output prefer-\nence pair by N times. Through LongWriter-V-22k\nSFT and IterDPO, our 7B model achieves impres-\nsive performance in both output length and quality,\nsurpassing powerful VLMs like GPT-4o.\nIn summary, our contributions are as follows:\n• We construct MMLongBench-Write to evalu-\nate the long-output capabilities of VLMs and\nfind that the output length limit of existing\nVLMs is around 1,000 words.\n• We collect the SFT dataset LongWrite-V-22k,\nenabling VLMs for 3,000+ word generation.\n• We propose IterDPO, which effectively im-\nproves the text quality of long-output VLM.\n2\nPreliminaries\nIn the preliminary experiments, we first collect\nMMLongBench-Write, a benchmark with visual\ninputs and long-output requirements. Then, we\nconduct an evaluation on this benchmark to explore\nthe maximum output length of VLMs. Besides, we\nreveal that the main reason for bounded output\nlength lies in the length distribution of SFT data.\nMMLongBench-Write. The ability to write long\ntexts based on visual inputs is a fundamental skill in\nvarious real-world applications and can be broadly\ncategorized into professional writing and creative\nwriting, depending on whether specialized knowl-\nedge is required (Taavitsainen and Pahta, 2000). To\nevaluate how well that VLMs master the two skills,\nwe design three specific tasks for each skill. For\neach task, we curate 20 representative instructions\nwith input images as test data. To ensure diver-\nsity, half instructions are in English and half are\nin Chinese. Figure 1 shows six examples of the\nbenchmark and data distribution. It highlights that\nprofessional writing tasks typically involve more\ninput images and require longer output lengths.\nLongWrite-V-Ruler. To explore the maximum\noutput length of VLMs, we select 8 examples\nfrom MMLongBench-Write benchmark, with four\n2\n\n500\n1k\n2k\n4k\nRequired Length\n500\n1k\n2k\n4k\nOutput Length\nClaude3V_Opus\nQwen2-VL-72B-Instruct\nQwen2-VL-7B-Instruct\nMiniCPM-V\nGPT-4o\nGPT-4V\nFigure 2: LongWriter-V-Ruler test across different out-\nput length requirements.

As de-\npicted in Figure 1, each instruction is in the form\nof \"Write an L-word article for the given pic-\ntures\". We construct a diverse test set by chang-\ning the length requirement L. This test set uses\nL ∈{500, 1000, 2000, 4000}, which consists of\n32 test prompts in total.\nEvaluation Result. We conduct the LongWrite-V-\nRuler test on three open-source VLMs and three\nproprietary models. In Figure 2, we plot the re-\nquired output length (x-axis) and the corresponding\naverage output length (y-axis) for 12 instructions.\nWe can observe that there exists an upper bound of\n1000 output length for all models.\nPreliminary Experiment. As the controlled exper-\niments in LongWriter (Bai et al., 2024) has revealed\nthat the maximum output length of LLM is corre-\nlated with the maximum output length of SFT data,\nwe further explore how the average output length\nof SFT data can influence the long-generation ca-\npabilities of VLM. We fine-tune Qwen2-VL-7B-\nInstruct (Wang et al., 2024a) on three visual in-\nstruction datasets sampled from our final SFT data.\nEach dataset has 10k examples with different aver-\nage output length respectively (0.8k, 1.8k and 2.8k).\nFigure 3 shows the trained models’ performance on\nLongWrite-V-Ruler, we observe that the model’s\nmaximum output length increases with the average\noutput length of SFT data. Besides, we find that\nthe number of long-output examples is crucial\nfor extending the output length of VLMs. For ex-\nample, the training set with an average length of\n1.8k contains 1% data exceeding 4k output length,\nbut the model trained on it fails to generate 4k to-\n500\n1k\n2k\n4k\nRequired Length\n500\n1k\n2k\n4k\nOutput Length\ntrained on avg. output length = 2.8k\ntrained on avg. output length = 1.8k\ntrained on avg. output length = 0.8k\nFigure 3: LongWriter-V-Ruler test for Qwen2-VL-7B-\nInstruct trained on 10k SFT data samples with different\naverage output lengths.\nkens (orange line). In contrast, the model trained\nwith 21% data exceeding 4k output length is able\nto do that (blue line). This result indicates that the\nmain reason that limits the VLM’s output length is\nlack of enough long-output examples in SFT data.\n3\nLongWriter-V: Data and Training\nIn this section, we will introduce the data collec-\ntion and training process for unlocking the long\ngeneration capability of vision-language models.\n3.1\nData Collection\nFigure 4 depicts the overall pipeline of our data\ncollection process, which consists of two phases:\nSFT and DPO data collection.\n3.1.1\nSFT Data Collection\nExisting VLMs fail to directly generate texts ex-\nceeding 1k tokens, so we develop a two-stage\nmethod to generate long texts as SFT data.\nLongWrite Agent-V. Before introducing our\nmethod, we first formalize the task’s objective.\nGiven several input images v and an user instruc-\ntion x, our goal is to generate a text y∗that aligned\nwith user’s length and quality requirements:\ny∗= arg max\ny\n(sl(y) + sq(y))Pθ(y|v, x)\n(1)\nwhere sl and sq is the scoring function for judging\nthe length and quality of the output, respectively.\nPθ is the function representing the end-to-end so-\nlution, while existing VLMs may not be directly\napplied as their maximum output lengths are be-\nlow 1k. To utilize off-the-shelf VLMs, we propose\n3\n\nInstruction\nFilter\nImage:\nInstruction:\nSFT Data Collection\nAnalyse this \nimage with\ndetails...\nSame-category Images:\nInstruction\nGenerator\nLongWrite\nAgent-V\nLongWrite\nAgent-V\nSingle-image Response:\nThis image depicts the Golden \nTemple, also known as \nHarmandir Sahib, located in \nIndia ...

It \nis a contemporary and influential \npiece of Islamic architecture. \nHuman-revised Output:\nFigure 4: SFT and DPO data collection pipeline of LongWriter-V. The SFT data includes both single-image and\nmulti-image input for long text output. The DPO data contains human revision over each paragraph of VLM’s long\noutput. We conduct iterative direct preference optimization to learn the fine-grained human feedback.\na two-stage method for generating long texts. In-\nspired by the plan-and-write method from Long-\nWriter (Bai et al., 2024), we first prompt the VLM\nto generate an outline o that structures the output,\nplans the content, and specifies the word count for\neach paragraph. This outline breaks down the com-\nplex long-output task into manageable sub-tasks.\nNext, we use the VLM to fill in each paragraph and\nconcatenate them to form the final output:\ny∗= arg max\no\nP1(o|v, x) arg max\ny\n(sl(y)+sq(y))P2\n(2)\nP2(y|v, x, o) =\nn\nY\ni=0\np(yi|v, x, oi, y<i)\n(3)\nwhere P1 is the modeling function for first stage,\nwhich takes input images and instruction to write\nan n-paragraph outline o = {oi, i = 1, ..., n}. P2\nrefers to the second stage, where the VLM outputs\nthe content yi paragraph by paragraph based on\nthe input information, outline oi and previous para-\ngraphs y<i. In practice, we design two detailed\nprompts for guiding VLM to implement the two\nstages, which are listed in Appendix B.2.\nVisual Instruction Collection. To collect long-\noutput visual instructions for SFT, we choose\nMMEvol (Luo et al., 2024) as our primary\ndata source.\nMMEvol is a large-scale, open-\ndomain dataset containing 480k image-text in-\nstruction pairs, sourced from diverse datasets\nsuch as LLaVA-Instruct (Liu et al., 2024a) and\nShareGPT4V (Chen et al., 2024a). However, the\naverage output length in this dataset is relatively\nshort (54.85 tokens), necessitating a filtering pro-\ncess to identify long-output instructions. We first\ncheck the original response length of e ach example\nand select those with output length over 128, yield-\ning 55,835 valid data. Next, we utilized GPT-4o to\nverify whether each instruction genuinely requires\na long output and whether the associated image\nwas sufficiently relevant to the instruction. Finally,\nwe get 8,115 single-image instructions.\nMulti-image Instruction Generation. As the orig-\ninal data in MMEvol only has one image for each\ninstruction, we synthesize some multi-image in-\nstructions to increase the diversity of SFT data.\n4\n\nWe select three subsets of MMEvol: wikiart, web-\nlandmark, web-celebrity. Each subset contains hun-\ndreds of images in the same category. For example,\nimages in web-landmark are all landmark pictures\ntaken from different world attractions. We ran-\ndomly sample 2 or 4 same-category images and\nthen ask gpt-4o to generate an instruction that re-\nquire long output for these images. We obtain 6,313\nmulti-image instructions in this way. Apart from\nsynthetic data, we also collect natural multi-image\ndata from an open-source PPT dataset, Zenodo10K\n(Zheng et al., 2025). We transform these slides\ninto images to use them as visual inputs and set\nthe instruction as \"Write a lecture script for these\nslides\". We choose those slides that has at least 2\npages and at most 30 pages, resulting in 7,730 data.\nBacktranslation. Through above processes, we\ncollect 22,158 single-image and multi-image in-\nstructions in total. Using the LongWrite Agent-\nV pipeline, we generate long output for each vi-\nsual instruction as SFT data. We call this train-\ning data LongWrite-V-22k. But most instructions\ndon’t specify the exact word count requirement,\nmodels trained on these data may lack the ability\nto follow the writing instruction with word count\nrequirements. Therefore, we sample 5,000 data\nfrom LongWrite-V-22k and calculate the length of\nthe output L then add a requirement \"Please write\nL-word in total.\" to the end of the instruction and\nuse gpt-4o-mini for rephrasing the instruction to\nmaintain consistency. This is inspired by previous\nbacktranslation (Li et al., 2023) method on training\nlong-output LLMs (Pham et al., 2024).\n3.1.2\nDPO Data Collection\nThe SFT data aims to extend VLMs’ output length.\nBut the longer outputs may bring more hallucina-\ntions and repetitions. So the follow up question is:\nhow to improve the generation fidelity of long out-\nput VLM? Previous works often adapt direct prefer-\nence optimization (Rafailov et al., 2024; Liu et al.,\n2024c) to correct the hallucinations of VLMs. We\nfollow the data format in RLHF-V (Yu et al., 2024a)\nwhich utilizes the human-annotated segment-level\ncorrections on VLM’s outputs as feedback.\nVLM Output Collection.\nTo collect long re-\nsponses, we select 100 slides that were not in-\ncluded in LongWrite-V-22k for VLM to gener-\nate scripts. These slides were previously used for\nteaching on MOOC platforms (Yu et al., 2020) and\ncover 10 subjects such as Computer Science, Math\nand Physics. Each subject may contain 4 to 16\n0\n1k\n2k\n3k\n4k\n5k\n6k\n7k\n8k\n9k\n10k\nOutput Length\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\n# of data\nOutput Length Distribution\nLongWrite-V-22k\nMean: 2037\nMedian: 1732\nFigure 5: Output length statistics of LongWrite-V-22k.\nslides and each slide may have 10 to 30 pages.\nWe use LongWriter-V-7B, the VLM trained on our\nSFT data, to generate scripts for each slide. The\nlong scripts are segmented by sections and aligned\nwith each page of the given slide. We find that\nLongWriter-V-7B tends to output fewer sections\nthan the number of total pages, which is one of the\nissues that we would ask human annotators to fix.\nHuman Revision Collection. To get high-quality\nfeedback on the flawed output of SFT model, we\nhire 10 college students from 10 different majors\ncorresponding to the subjects of our slides. We\nrequired annotators to have a GPA above 3.8 to\nensure their expertise. To facilitate the annota-\ntion process, we build an online platform (See Ap-\npendix C.1). Each annotator will get slides that\nmatch with their major.The platform displays each\nslide page alongside the corresponding script seg-\nment generated by the SFT model. We ask anno-\ntators to check and revise each page’s script for\nthe following error types: factual errors, missing\ninformation, relevance to the image, coherence of\nsentences, and repetition of words. After complet-\ning the annotation of a slide, our authors will review\nthe annotation quality. Ultimately, we get 72 valid\nscripts with fine-grained human corrections.\n3.2\nTraining\nSupervised Fine-tuning. We conduct model train-\ning based on two open-source VLMs with dif-\nferent parameter sizes: Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct\nand Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct (Team, 2025). We\nchoose Qwen2.5-VL series as base model because\nthey support a context window of 32k tokens. By\nresizing the input image’s width and height to\n280x280, the Qwen2.5-VL models can process up\nto 30 images. As shown in Figure 5, the output\nlength in LongWrite-V-22k are distributed between\n0 and 10k with two peaks around 0 and 1.5k. The\n5\n\npeak at 0 indicates some short output data is mixed\nin the LongWrite-V-22k, which are mainly the re-\nsults of those simple instructions. To get a bet-\nter length distribution, we sample 10k data from\nLongWrite-V-22k with an average output length of\n2.8k as training data. We then fine-tune the two\nmodels for 3 epochs with a learning rate of 1e-5 for\nQwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and 7e-6 for Qwen2.5-\nVL-72B-Instruct, resulting in two SFT models:\nLongWriter-V-7B and LongWriter-V-72B.\nIterative Direct Preference Optimization. After\nSFT phase, DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024) is a widely-\nused method to optimize VLM’s output quality,\nwhich learns from a dataset of preference pairs\nD = {(v, x, yw, yl)}, where the winning output yw\nis preferred over the losing output yl given the same\nvisual input v and text input x. The optimization\nobjective of DPO is to maximize the difference\nbetween likelihood of preference pairs:\nLDPO(πθ; πref) = −E(v,x,yw,yl)∼D\n[log σ(β log πθ(yw|v, x)\nπref(yw|v, x) −β log πθ(yl|v, x)\nπref(yl|v, x))]\n(4)\nIn our annotation process, v represents the images\nof a slide, x is the instruction for generating scripts,\nyl is the flawed output script of VLM and yw is\nthe slide’s lecture after human revision. However,\ncollecting human feedback on long output is very\ntime-consuming and expensive. As mentioned in\nSection 3.1.2, we gather 72 preference pairs on the\nscripts, which costs one week and around 1,000\n$ to finish. To make most use of these data, we\npropose to iteratively learn the fine-grained human\ncorrectional feedback on the long output. As the\nyw = {yi\nw, i = 1, ...N} is a revised script for an N\npage slide, we increasingly view each page’s script\nyi\nw as a winning segment over the flawed script:\nLIterDPO(πθ; πref) = −E(v,x,yw,yl)∼D\nN\nX\ni=1\n[log σ(β log πθ(y≤i\nw |v≤i, x)\nπref(y≤i\nw |v≤i, x)\n−β log πθ(y≤i\nl |v≤i, x)\nπref(y≤i\nl |v≤i, x)\n)]\n(5)\nwhere y≤i\nw , y≤i\nl\nis the revised and unrevised scripts\nuntil page i, and v≤i are the corresponding images.\nWe view y≤i\nw as a new wining response over the\nflawed output y≤i\nl , this can help VLM learn the\nfine-grained feedback on the long output and ex-\ntend the number preference pairs for N times. In\nthis way, we get 1,477 iterative pairs for training.\nApart from human feedback, we also utilize AI\nfeedback by employing the gpt4o as the reward\nmodel. Following RLAIF (Yu et al., 2024b), we\nsample responses from the SFT model for 1,367\nlong-output instructions and use GPT-4o for assign-\ning length and quality scores for the responses to\nconstruct preference pairs. Our final DPO model is\ntrained with 2,844 mixed preference pairs,\n4\nExperiments\n4.1\nExperimental Setup\nMetric. Following Bai et al. (2024), we evaluate\nthe VLM’s output length and quality using two\nmetrics: Sl and Sq. Sl is the output score that\nmeasures how close that the VLM’s output length\nlv is to the required length lr:\nSl =\n\n\n\n100 · max\n\u0010\n0, 1 −(lv/lr−1)\n3\n\u0011\nif lv > lr,\n100 · max\n\u0010\n0, 1 −(lr/lv−1)\n2\n\u0011\nif lv ≤lr.\n(6)\nWe also use gpt-4o-2024-08-06 to assign the qual-\nity score Sq for six aspects: Relevance, Accuracy,\nCoherence, Clarity, Breadth and Depth, and Read-\ning Experience. We list the scoring prompt in Ap-\npendix D. Note that we have asked gpt-4o not to\ntake the output length into account so that the qual-\nity score is independent with the length score. The\noverall score S is the mean of Sl and Sq.\nBaselines.\nWe evaluate 3 proprietary VLMs,\n3\nopen-source\nVLMs\nand\n4\nLLMs\non\nMMLongBench-Write\n(model\ndetails\nabout\nmodels are listed in Table 3). Given that LLMs\ncan also process visual instructions via reading\nthe image caption (Ma et al., 2024), we first use\ngpt-4o to describe the input images and then feed\nthe caption and writing instruction to the LLM.\n4.2\nMain Results\nWe report the performance of baselines and our\ntrained models in Table 1.\nTo study the ef-\nfective output length of models, we divide the\nMMLongBench-Write benchmark into four subsets\nbased on the instruction’s required word count: 0-\n1500 words, 1500-2000 words, 2000-3000 words,\nand over 3000 words. The highest length and qual-\nity scores for each subset among models are in\nbold.

Note that LLMs are tested with input images transformed\ninto captions. We report scores on different subsets of the benchmark, where [0,1000) means the expected output\nlength falls within 0 to 1000 tokens. S, Sl, Sq is the overall score, length score and quality score respectively.\nperform poorly on the [2000, 3000) range, with\ntheir Sl below 70. In contrast, our LongWriter-V\nmodels can generate outputs with effective length\nand high quality even on the range of [3000, 4000).\n(2) The scaling law effect on our benchmark is strik-\ning: smaller models like Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct\nperform poorly in our evaluation with an overall\nscore of 54.4, while its larger counterpart Qwen2.5-\nVL-72B-Instruct achieves a notably higher score\nof 83.3. Besides, after training the two VLMs\non our LongWrite-V-22k data, both models im-\nprove significantly on long generation. The per-\nformance gap between the two sizes’ models is\nnarrowed after SFT (LongWriter-V-7B’s 81.8 vs.\nLongWriter-V-72B’s 84.9). (3) DPO can improve\nboth the VLM’s output quality and the ability to\nfollow the length requirements of long generation.\nLongWriter-V-7B-DPO, which is the model trained\non LongWriter-V-7B with 2,844 preference pairs,\nachieves improvement on both Sl (+3.7) and Sq\n(+1.8), showing that DPO is effective for boosting\nthe long generation capabilities of VLMs.\n4.3\nHuman Evaluation\nAs the quality score Sq is assigned by the GPT-\n4o automatically, the evaluation results may have\nbias as LLM tends to favor the responses generated\nby itself (Wang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024a). To\nget a more fair quality comparison for the mod-\nels, we conduct a human evaluation to capture\nthe actual human preferences on model responses.\nSpecifically, we select responses from four mod-\nels: the three models trained by us and the GPT-\n4o-2024-08-06 baseline. We ask two human an-\nnotators to vote for their preferred response be-\ntween two selected models on the 120 responses\nof MMLongBench-Write. For each annotator, we\ncollect 720 votes and calculate the average win rate\namong models using two annotators’ feedback.\nThe results are shown in Figure 6, where we sur-\nprisingly find that two of our trained models receive\nmore votes from humans in the comparison with\nthe GPT-4o-2024-08-06 baseline. While in the au-\ntomatic quality score comparison, the two models\nalso surpass the GPT-4o on the quality score. This\nindicates that our trained models have gained some\nadvantages over the GPT-4o baseline in the human\npreference, which is consistent with the automatic\nevaluation on the quality score of responses.\n4.4\nAblation Study\nWe conduct ablation experiments on both the SFT\nand DPO process of LongWriter-V models. For\nthe LongWriter-V-7B model trained on LongWrite-\nV-22k data, we control the three data sources of\nLongWrite-V-22k to observe how they contribute\nto the final performance of the SFT model. We run\nthe SFT process on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct with-\n7\n\nGPT4o\nLongWriter-V-7B-DPO\nLongWriter-V-72B\nLongWriter-V-7B\nGPT4o\nLongWriter-V-7B-DPO\nLongWriter-V-72B\nLongWriter-V-7B\n0.433\n0.388\n0.514\n0.567\n0.394\n0.525\n0.613\n0.606\n0.661\n0.486\n0.475\n0.339\n0.35\n0.40\n0.45\n0.50\n0.55\n0.60\n0.65\nFigure 6: Human evaluation results on MMLongBench-\nWrite, where each block of the matrix represents the\nmodel of the row’s win rate over the model of the col-\numn. The win rate is voted by two annotators.\nout (w/o) single-image, multi-image or backtrans-\nlation data respectively and evaluate the trained\nmodels on MMLongBench-Write. As shown in Ta-\nble 2, removing any of these data sources may lead\nto a decline in the overall score, where multi-image\ndata is the most essential one, causing a decrease of\n15.3 overall score. These results indicate that these\nsources are useful for training long output VLMs.\nTo explore the effectiveness of our iterative DPO\nstrategy over the small size preference data on long-\noutput VLM alignment, we run the DPO process\nwithout those extra pairs extended by the iterative\nstrategy. Results in Table 2 demonstrates that the\nmodel gains +1.1 length score but -1.1 quality score\nand -2.5 PPT task score over the DPO model with\nfull data, which means the extended data is useful\nfor the generation quality and the PPT script task.\nTo examine the effectiveness of mixing AI prefer-\nence pairs, we then train the SFT model with the\nhuman revised preference pairs only, resulting in a\neven worse performance (-1.1 overall score against\nthe SFT model). This suggests that incorporating\nAI-generated pairs can improve model performance\nby providing additional training signals.\n5\nRelated Work\nRecent advancements in Vision-Language Mod-\nels have focused on enhancing their ability to\nprocess long-context inputs (Ge et al., 2024; Li\net al., 2024b; Chen et al., 2024c).\nThere are\nabundant benchmarks and datasets that designed\nfor multimodal long context understanding includ-\ning MMLongBench-Doc (Ma et al., 2024), Long-\nModel\nS\nSl\nSq\nSPPT\nLongWriter-V-7B\n81.8\n82.5\n81.1\n83.1\nw/o single-image data\n79.6\n79.5\n79.6\n83.4\nw/o multi-image data\n66.5\n60.3\n72.7\n29.3\nw/o backtranslation\n80.7\n80.0\n81.3\n82.4\nLongWriter-V-7B-DPO\n84.6\n86.3\n82.9\n85.8\nw/o iterative pairs\n84.6\n87.4\n81.8\n83.3\nw/o 1.4k gpt4o feedback\n80.7\n78.7\n82.7\n71.7\nTable 2: Scores (%) on MMLongBench-Write for mod-\nels trained under different conditions, where S, Sl and\nSq is the overall, length and quality score on all tasks\nand SP P T is the overall score on the PPT script task.\nDocURL (Deng et al., 2024), LongViTU (Wu\net al., 2025), ShareGPT4Video (Chen et al.,\n2024b), LongVideoBench (Wu et al., 2024a) and\nLVBench (Wang et al., 2024c). However, the long-\noutput generation abilities of VLMs have been\nless explored. In our work, we find that current\nVLMs struggle to generate an output with over\n1000 tokens, which is much shorter than their max\ninput context length (>16,000 tokens) (Wang et al.,\n2024a). To fill this gap, we explore how to extend\nthe maximum output length of VLMs.\nAlthough we show that supervised fine-tuning\ncan align VLMs with user’s instructions on length\nrequirements, it is also important to improve the\nquality of long output (Wu et al., 2024b). Previous\nworks mainly focus on how to improve VLMs’ gen-\neration quality on short output tasks via post train-\ning methods such as RLHF-V (Yu et al., 2024a),\nRLAIF-V (Yu et al., 2024b), POVID (Zhou et al.,\n2024) and MIA-DPO (Liu et al., 2024c). However,\nnone of these methods have explored how to ef-\nfectively use human correctional feedback on long\noutput for aligning VLMs. We propose to itera-\ntively use each segment of the revised long output\nas the preferred response, which extends the num-\nber of preference pairs and successfully improves\nthe long generation quality of VLM.\n6\nConclusion\nOur\nwork\nintroduces\nMMLongBench-Write,\na\ncomprehensive\nbenchmark\nfor\nevaluating\nlong-generation tasks with visual inputs, and\nLongWriter-V-22k, a novel supervised fine-tuning\ndataset designed to enhance the long-output\ncapabilities of VLMs. Furthermore, our proposed\nIterDPO method effectively leverages human\nfeedback to improve the fidelity of long outputs,\naddressing issues such as hallucination. Future\n8\n\nresearch may explore more efficient training\nstrategies and larger datasets to further push the\nboundaries of long-output generation in VLMs.\nLimitations\nWe acknowledge some limitations in our work,\nwhich are listed below: 1. Dataset Size: The size\nof our LongWriter-V-22k dataset may not be suffi-\nciently large to fully capture the diversity of long-\noutput generation tasks. While this dataset size is\nadequate for initial exploration and training, it may\nlimit the robustness of our findings and the gener-\nalizability of our model’s performance. Expanding\nthe dataset to include more examples would require\nsignificant additional resources, both in terms of\ndata collection and annotation costs. 2. Language\nLimitation: The current dataset and benchmark\nare limited to English and Chinese only. This re-\nstricts our ability to evaluate the performance of\nVLMs across multiple languages, which is crucial\nfor real-world applications where multilingual sup-\nport is often required. Future work should con-\nsider expanding the dataset to include other lan-\nguages to provide a more comprehensive evalua-\ntion of VLMs’ long-output capabilities. 3. Human\nFeedback Efficiency: While our IterDPO method\nsignificantly improves the efficiency of utilizing\nhuman feedback for long outputs, the process of\ncollecting high-quality human corrections remains\ntime-consuming and costly. This limits the scalabil-\nity of our approach and the frequency with which\nwe can update and refine the training data. Fu-\nture work should explore more efficient methods\nfor obtaining and incorporating human feedback to\nfurther enhance model performance.\nEthical Consideration\nWhile our work on enhancing the long-output ca-\npabilities of Vision-Language Models represents a\nsignificant advancement, VLMs may still generate\ninaccurate or misleading information, especially\nwhen dealing with common knowledge not explic-\nitly present in the context. This can lead to the\npropagation of false information if not properly\nmanaged. Therefore, additional safeguards and ver-\nification mechanisms should be implemented when\ndeploying these models in user-facing applications.\nOur training data has been desensitized to pro-\ntect individual privacy. All the data sources we\nused are public available with permissible licenses,\nincluding MMEvol (Luo et al., 2024) and Zen-\nodo10K (Zheng et al., 2025).\nReferences\nJean-Baptiste Alayrac, Jeff Donahue, Pauline Luc,\nAntoine Miech, Iain Barr, Yana Hasson, Karel\nLenc, Arthur Mensch, Katherine Millican, Malcolm\nReynolds, et al. 2022.

Our focus will be on\nunderstanding the fundamental concepts of kinetic energy, potential energy, and the roles of air\nresistance and friction. These concepts are not just theoretical; they have practical implications in our\ndaily lives, especially in the context of transportation.\nLet’s begin by considering the significance of transportation in energy consumption. In the United\nStates, transportation accounts for approximately 28% of total energy use, which translates to about\n30 exajoules per year. This sector also contributes to one-third of the country’s CO2 emissions.\nUnderstanding the mechanics behind transportation can help us devise strategies to reduce energy use\nand emissions.\nFirst, let’s delve into kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion. The formula for kinetic energy\nis Ekin = 1\n2mv2, where m is mass and v is velocity. Consider a baseball thrown at 100 mph; its\nkinetic energy is around 150 joules. While this is a small amount of energy, it illustrates the concept\neffectively. Now, imagine a car like a Toyota Camry with four passengers moving at 60 mph. The\nkinetic energy here is approximately 700 kilojoules, demonstrating how energy scales with mass and\nvelocity.\nLet’s explore a practical example: a road trip from Boston to New York, a distance of 210 miles.\nSuppose the car in question achieves 30 miles per gallon and consumes 7 gallons of fuel for the trip,\nequating to 840 megajoules of energy. However, not all this energy is used for motion. The kinetic\nenergy required is only about 0.7 megajoules. So, where does the rest of the energy go? Factors like\nengine efficiency, air resistance, and friction play significant roles.\nNext, we’ll explore potential energy, which is stored energy based on an object’s position or configu-\nration. A fundamental principle here is energy conservation: energy cannot be created or destroyed,\n21\n\nonly transformed. Consider a ball rolling uphill; kinetic energy is converted into potential energy.\nThe potential energy, U, is given by U = mgh, where g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is\nheight. Springs are another example, where potential energy is stored as U = 1\n2kx2.\nNow, let’s consider potential energy in the context of forces and work. For a mass subject to a force,\nthe work done is the force multiplied by the distance moved. This work results in energy transfer,\nsuch as converting potential energy to kinetic energy. In vector terms, for motion in a line, force is\nrelated to potential energy by F = −dU\ndx .\nLet’s apply these concepts to real-world scenarios. Consider an airplane cruising at altitude; its kinetic\nenergy is significant. But potential energy also plays a crucial role, especially at high altitudes. Other\napplications include using potential energy to pump water uphill or using elevators and cranes.\nReturning to our road trip example, we must consider the potential energy effects of hills. A constant\nspeed of 60 mph with elevation gains requires additional energy. Suppose the car gains 50 feet per\nmile; the energy needed per hill becomes substantial. Despite this, the total energy for hills remains\nless than the energy output from the engine, highlighting the inefficiency of energy conversion in\ntransportation.\nAir resistance and friction are also critical factors in energy consumption. As a car moves, it collides\nwith air molecules, creating a wake. This interaction results in energy loss, calculated using the drag\ncoefficient. For example, a Toyota Camry traveling from Boston to New York loses a considerable\namount of energy to air resistance. The drag force depends on factors like speed and surface area, and\nreducing these can improve efficiency.\nFinally, let’s summarize our findings. The total energy expenditure for our road trip includes kinetic\nenergy, potential energy of hills, rolling resistance, and air resistance. The gasoline energy far exceeds\nthese values, illustrating the inefficiency of internal combustion engines, which are only about 25%\nefficient. This inefficiency is even more pronounced in city driving, where acceleration and rolling\nresistance dominate.\nTo reduce transport energy costs, we can apply simple physics principles. Driving at lower speeds,\nstreamlining vehicles, inflating tires, using more efficient engines, and employing regenerative braking\nare effective strategies. In an ideal world, with these measures and advanced technologies like vacuum\ntunnels, we could drastically reduce transport energy expenditure.\nIn conclusion, understanding mechanical energy, particularly in transportation, provides insights into\nimproving energy efficiency and reducing environmental impact. As we continue to innovate and\napply these principles, we move closer to a more sustainable future.\nThank you for your attention. Please review your lecture notes in preparation for our next topic: Heat.\nResponse of LongWriter-V-72B:\n1. Today, we delve into mechanical energy, a crucial topic in physics with broad applications,\nespecially in transportation. The U.S. dedicates nearly 28% of its energy to transport, amounting to\nabout 30 exajoules annually and contributing to a third of the nation’s CO2 emissions. Grasping this\nimpact is essential for developing sustainable solutions. We’ll examine how kinetic and potential\nenergy, along with friction and air resistance, shape transport dynamics. This understanding not only\nilluminates our current energy use but also fuels innovation for future efficiency. As we proceed,\nreflect on how these principles connect to real-world challenges and inspire advancements in energy\nconservation.\n2. Building on our introduction to mechanical energy, let’s examine its pivotal role in transportation.\nThe U.S. dedicates around 28% of its energy to this sector, which consumes approximately 30\nexajoules annually and accounts for a third of the country’s CO2 emissions. This underscores the\nnecessity for sustainable practices. To tackle these challenges, we must understand kinetic and\npotential energy, as well as friction and air resistance. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, while\npotential energy is stored energy with the potential to perform work. Friction and air resistance\nare forces that impede motion, impacting energy efficiency. Grasping these concepts is crucial for\n22\n\noptimizing transportation systems. As we delve deeper, consider how these principles can inform\ninnovations in energy conservation and efficiency, driving progress toward a more sustainable future.\n3. Let’s delve into kinetic energy, the energy a moving object possesses. The formula for kinetic\nenergy is Ekin = 1\n2mv2, where m represents mass and v represents velocity. This equation reveals\nthat kinetic energy is proportional to an object’s mass and the square of its speed.\nConsider a baseball traveling at 100 mph. Its kinetic energy is approximately 150 joules. Now, think\nabout a Camry carrying four passengers moving at 60 mph; its kinetic energy jumps to around 700\nkilojoules. This comparison illustrates how both mass and velocity significantly affect kinetic energy.\nTo further clarify, let’s examine the energy needed for 100 pitches of a baseball. This amounts to\nabout 15 kilojoules, a small fraction of the 10 megajoules of energy a person typically consumes\ndaily through food.\nThese examples highlight the importance of understanding kinetic energy in various contexts, from\nsports to transportation. As we proceed, consider how these principles apply to real-world scenarios\nand how they can inform innovations in energy efficiency and sustainability.\n4. Let’s delve into a real-world application of energy principles by considering a road trip from\nBoston to New York in a Camry with four passengers. This 210-mile journey requires about 7 gallons\nof gasoline, equating to roughly 840 megajoules of energy. But where does this energy go?\nFirstly, kinetic energy is a factor; a 4000-pound car at 60 mph possesses about 0.7 megajoules of\nkinetic energy. Yet, this is a small portion of the total energy used. We must also consider the engine’s\nefficiency, typically around 25%, meaning much of the energy is lost as heat.\nMoreover, friction and air resistance play significant roles. These forces oppose the car’s motion,\nnecessitating additional energy to maintain speed. Climbing hills further increases energy demands,\nconverting kinetic energy into potential energy.\nThis scenario prompts us to question the necessity of such energy expenditures. Are there ways to\noptimize our vehicles and driving habits to enhance efficiency? Reflect on how understanding these\nprinciples can lead to more sustainable practices in transportation. By grasping where energy is\nutilized and wasted, we can explore innovative solutions to reduce consumption and environmental\nimpact.\n5. Now, let’s turn our attention to potential energy, a fundamental idea in physics. It represents stored\nenergy within a system, ready to perform work. The principle of energy conservation is key here:\nenergy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.\nConsider lifting an object; as it ascends, its kinetic energy converts into potential energy, expressed as\nU = mgh, where m is mass, g is gravitational acceleration, and h is height. This potential energy\ncan revert to kinetic energy if the object falls.\nA practical example is a compressed spring. The energy you expend to compress it becomes potential\nenergy, U = 1\n2kx2, with k as the spring constant and x as the displacement. When released, this\nenergy transforms back into kinetic energy.\nUnderstanding potential energy is vital for analyzing systems and predicting motion. It enables us to\ncalculate energy transformations and optimize processes, from elevators to water pumps. Reflect on\nhow these concepts apply to everyday technologies and how they might inspire innovations in energy\nstorage and efficiency.\n6. Building on our understanding of potential energy, let’s explore its relationship with forces and\nwork. When an object is displaced in a potential field, like gravity or a spring, a force acts upon it.\nThis force is derived from the potential energy gradient, expressed as F = −dU\ndx , where U is potential\nenergy and x is position.\nWork is done when a force moves an object over a distance, quantified as W = F × d. In the context\nof potential energy, this work equates to the change in potential energy, ∆U. For instance, lifting an\nobject increases its gravitational potential energy, while compressing a spring increases its elastic\npotential energy.\nThese concepts are crucial in physics, as they enable us to analyze and predict system behavior. By\nunderstanding the forces and work involved, we can optimize energy use in various applications, from\n23\n\ndesigning efficient machines to developing renewable energy systems. Consider how these principles\napply to real-world scenarios and inspire innovations in energy efficiency and sustainability.\n7. Expanding on our discussion, let’s delve into potential energy in two and three dimensions using\nvectors. In 2D and 3D spaces, potential energy becomes a function of multiple variables, such as\nU(x, y, z).\nThe gradient of potential energy, denoted as ∇U, is a vector that points in the direction of the greatest\nincrease in potential energy. The force acting on an object can be derived from this gradient, expressed\nas F = −∇U. The negative sign indicates that the force acts in the direction of decreasing potential\nenergy.\nFor example, in a gravitational field, the potential energy is given by U = −GMm\nr\n, where G is the\ngravitational constant, M and m are masses, and r is the distance between them. The corresponding\nforce is F = −∇U = −GMm\nr2\nˆr, which is the familiar inverse-square law of gravity.\nUnderstanding these vector relationships is essential for analyzing complex systems, such as planetary\nmotion or electromagnetic interactions. It allows us to predict and explain the behavior of objects\nunder various forces, inspiring innovations in fields like robotics and aerospace engineering. Reflect\non how these principles apply to real-world technologies and consider their potential to drive future\nadvancements.\n8. Let’s delve into the practical applications of potential energy, beginning with aircraft. At cruising\naltitude, a 747 carries substantial potential energy, calculated as U = mgh, where m is the aircraft’s\nmass, g is gravitational acceleration, and h is its height. For a 747 at 40,000 feet, this equates to about\n41 gigajoules.\nPotential energy is also pivotal in energy storage systems. Pumped-storage hydroelectricity is a prime\nexample, where water is pumped uphill to a reservoir during off-peak hours. When demand rises, the\nwater is released to generate electricity, effectively converting stored potential energy into kinetic\nenergy, which then powers turbines.\nIn urban settings, potential energy is harnessed in elevators and cranes. Elevators utilize counter-\nweights to minimize energy consumption during vertical movement, while cranes employ potential\nenergy to lift heavy loads efficiently.\nThese examples underscore the significance of potential energy in modern engineering and its role\nin sustainable energy solutions. Reflect on how these principles can inspire innovations in energy\nefficiency and storage, contributing to a greener future.\n9. Let’s revisit our road trip scenario to delve into the role of potential energy. Even though Boston\nand New York are at sea level, the journey between them involves elevation changes that significantly\nimpact energy consumption.\nAs you ascend hills, your vehicle converts kinetic energy into potential energy, stored due to increased\nheight. This process demands extra energy, which is then partly recovered as you descend, converting\npotential energy back into kinetic energy. However, not all energy is recaptured due to losses from\nfriction and air resistance.\nUnderstanding these dynamics is vital for optimizing vehicle efficiency. By analyzing elevation\nprofiles, we can better predict energy requirements and improve fuel economy. This knowledge not\nonly enhances road trip efficiency but also informs the development of smarter navigation systems\nand more fuel-efficient vehicles.\nConsider how these principles might be applied to other modes of transport, such as trains or ships, to\nreduce energy usage and environmental impact. Reflect on potential innovations that could further\nminimize energy loss, contributing to sustainable transportation solutions.\n10. To estimate the energy impact of hills during a road trip, consider a car traveling at a steady 60\nmph, encountering a 50-foot elevation gain per mile. This incline necessitates additional energy to\nelevate the vehicle, calculated using the potential energy formula U = mgh, where m is the car’s\nmass, g is gravitational acceleration, and h is the height increase.\nFor a 1800 kg car, the energy required to climb each hill is approximately 260 kJ. Over a 210-mile\ntrip, this accumulates to about 27 MJ. However, descending the hills doesn’t fully recover this energy\n24\n\ndue to energy losses from braking and friction.\nThese calculations highlight the significant energy demands of hilly terrains. By understanding these\ndynamics, we can develop strategies to optimize fuel efficiency, such as using regenerative braking\nsystems to capture energy during descents.\nReflect on how this knowledge can inform route planning and vehicle design to enhance efficiency and\nsustainability. Consider potential innovations that could further minimize energy loss, contributing to\na greener future in transportation.\n11. Now, let’s delve into the impact of air resistance on vehicle energy efficiency. As a car moves, it\ndisplaces air molecules, creating drag that reduces efficiency. The energy lost to air resistance can be\ncalculated using the formula ∆Eair = 1\n2cd(∆mair)v2, where cd is the drag coefficient, ∆mair is the\nmass of displaced air, and v is the velocity.\nFor a typical car traveling at 60 mph, this results in a substantial energy loss. The loss increases with\nthe square of the velocity, meaning higher speeds lead to significantly greater energy expenditure. For\ninstance, a Toyota Camry traveling from Boston to New York at 60 mph loses about 133 MJ to air\nresistance, but this increases to 236 MJ at 80 mph.\nUnderstanding these dynamics is crucial for enhancing vehicle efficiency. Designing more aerody-\nnamic vehicles with lower drag coefficients can mitigate these losses. Additionally, maintaining\noptimal speeds can drastically improve fuel efficiency.\nReflect on how these principles can be applied to everyday driving to reduce energy consumption and\nenvironmental impact. Consider potential innovations in vehicle design and technology that could\nfurther minimize air resistance and contribute to sustainable transportation solutions.\n12. Let’s delve deeper into the energy lost to air resistance during a road trip. For a Toyota Camry\ntraveling from Boston to New York at 60 mph, approximately 133 MJ is lost to air resistance. This\nsignificant amount highlights the impact of aerodynamics on fuel efficiency.\nIncreasing speed exacerbates this issue. At 80 mph, the energy loss rises to about 236 MJ, demonstrat-\ning that higher speeds demand more energy to overcome air resistance. This is because the energy\nloss is proportional to the square of the velocity.\nIn addition to air resistance, rolling resistance also plays a role. This is the energy lost due to tire\ndeformation and road friction. For a typical car, rolling resistance can account for around 54 MJ over\nthe same distance.\nUnderstanding these factors is crucial for improving vehicle efficiency. Designing more aerodynamic\nvehicles and maintaining optimal speeds can significantly reduce energy loss. Keeping tires properly\ninflated is another simple yet effective way to minimize rolling resistance.\nReflect on how these principles can be applied to everyday driving to enhance efficiency and reduce\nenvironmental impact.

Now, let’s wrap up our energy analysis for the road trip from Boston to New York. We start with\nkinetic energy, about 2 MJ, accounting for stops along the way. Then, there’s the 27 MJ for potential\nenergy, spent on climbing hills. Rolling resistance adds another 54 MJ, and air resistance claims a\nsignificant 133 MJ. Altogether, these factors total 216 MJ of energy used.\nHowever, the gasoline used provides 840 MJ, indicating an overall efficiency of roughly 25%. This\nmeans only a quarter of the fuel’s energy is utilized for motion, with the rest lost as heat and other\ninefficiencies.\nThis analysis underscores the inefficiencies in automobile energy usage. By grasping these com-\nponents, we can pinpoint areas for improvement. For instance, enhancing aerodynamics, reducing\nrolling resistance, and optimizing vehicle weight can boost efficiency.\nReflect on how these insights can inform future innovations in vehicle design and technology. Consider\nhow better understanding these dynamics can lead to more sustainable and efficient transportation\nsolutions, reducing our environmental impact.\n14. To enhance transport efficiency, we can apply fundamental physics principles. Reducing air\nresistance is key, as it significantly impacts energy consumption. By traveling at lower speeds—opting\n25\n\nfor 60 mph instead of 80 mph—we diminish drag and boost fuel efficiency. Streamlined vehicle\ndesigns also help cut through air more effortlessly.\nPublic transportation offers another efficient alternative, as buses and trains inherently possess lower\nper capita drag. Maintaining vehicles with properly inflated tires is crucial, as it reduces rolling\nresistance and conserves energy.\nInnovative technologies, like regenerative braking, capture energy during braking, which can be\nreused, enhancing overall efficiency. This technology is particularly effective in stop-and-go traffic,\nmaximizing energy savings.\nLooking ahead, concepts such as vacuum tunnels and magnetic levitation could revolutionize trans-\nportation by drastically reducing air and rolling resistance. While these ideas are futuristic, they\ndemonstrate the potential for significant advancements in energy efficiency.\nReflect on how these principles and innovations might be integrated into everyday travel. Consider\ntheir role in reducing environmental impact and fostering sustainable transportation solutions.\n15.

Kinetic Energy**\nLet’s continue our exploration of mechanical energy by examining kinetic energy, an essential element\nof transportation. The formula for kinetic energy is Ekin = 1\n2mv2, where m is the mass and v is the\nspeed. This formula reveals kinetic energy’s direct relationship with both mass and velocity squared.\nImagine a baseball traveling at 100 mph. Its kinetic energy can be calculated using the formula,\nrevealing the significant energy involved in fast-moving objects. Now, consider a car with four\npassengers traveling from Boston to New York. The kinetic energy involved in this journey highlights\nthe extensive energy requirements in transportation.\nBeyond calculations, understanding kinetic energy’s role is vital. It affects how vehicles accelerate,\nbrake, and navigate, influencing both safety and efficiency. Recognizing these dynamics encourages\nus to critically consider transportation systems’ energy use and environmental impact.\nAs we move forward, think about how kinetic energy considerations might lead to advancements in\nmore efficient and sustainable transport methods. Reflect on the broader implications for energy use\nand conservation in our daily lives.\n**2. Mechanical Energy**\nTransportation is a major player in the U.S. energy scene, using up about 28% of the nation’s energy\nresources. In 2001, transportation sector energy consumption was roughly 30 Exajoules annually,\naccounting for approximately one-third of the U.S. CO2 emissions. Grasping the mechanics of\ntransportation is essential to tackle energy use and environmental concerns effectively.\nWithin transportation, the kinetic and potential energy involved in vehicles’ movement are crucial.\nKinetic energy relates to moving vehicles, impacting acceleration, speed, and braking. In contrast,\npotential energy arises from height or position, like when a car climbs a hill. Both types of energy are\ninterwoven with the forces of friction and air resistance, which dissipate energy and affect efficiency.\n26\n\nAnalyzing these energy forms helps us critically assess the efficiency and sustainability of our\ntransportation methods. As we delve deeper, consider how a solid foundation in these mechanical\nprinciples can inspire innovations for a more energy-efficient future. Reflect on the potential to\nminimize environmental impact while maximizing energy use in transportation systems.\n**3. Kinetic Energy**\nLet’s delve deeper into the concept of kinetic energy, which is crucial for understanding transportation.\nThe formula for kinetic energy is Ekin = 1\n2mv2, where m is the mass and v is the speed. This formula\nreveals that kinetic energy is directly proportional to the mass and the square of the velocity.\nImagine a baseball traveling at 100 mph. Its kinetic energy can be calculated to appreciate the energy\nof fast-moving objects. Now, consider a car with four passengers on a journey from Boston to New\nYork. The kinetic energy involved highlights the significant energy requirements in transportation.\nKinetic energy plays a vital role in transportation by influencing everything from fuel efficiency to\nemissions. Understanding these energy dynamics encourages critical thinking about how we can\nenhance transportation systems to make them more efficient and environmentally friendly. Reflect on\nhow these principles might inspire innovations in the design and operation of vehicles.\nFor instance, think about how reducing a car’s mass or modifying its speed can substantively affect\nits kinetic energy. How might these changes lead to greater fuel efficiency and lower emissions?\nGrasping these concepts not only enhances appreciation for mechanical principles but also encourages\nus to envision a sustainable future.\n**4. Transport Energy Example: Road Trip**\nLet’s examine a practical example of transport energy using a road trip from Boston to New York.\nThis journey covers about 210 miles and requires a Camry with four passengers.\nTo begin, we calculate the energy consumption. The car’s fuel efficiency is 30 miles per gallon, and\ngasoline contains roughly 120 megajoules per gallon. Thus, for this trip, the Camry will consume 7\ngallons of gasoline, totaling approximately 840 megajoules of energy.\nBut where does all this energy go? Part of it is used to overcome kinetic energy—the energy of\nmotion—while the car travels at speeds of around 60 miles per hour. The remaining energy is used to\ncounteract forces like friction and air resistance, which work to slow the car down.\nThis example prompts us to ponder: Is the full 840 megajoules truly necessary? Are there ways to\noptimize energy use? By reflecting on these questions, we can explore strategies to enhance efficiency\nand sustainability in transportation.\nUnderstanding energy expenditure in road trips allows us to critically evaluate transportation systems.\nIt invites us to consider how reducing friction, optimizing speed, and improving fuel efficiency\ncould lead to substantial energy savings. Such insights are vital for developing more sustainable\ntransportation methods.\nAs we proceed, think about how these principles can be applied to other forms of transport. How\nmight they help us craft a future with lower energy costs and a smaller environmental footprint?\n**5. Potential Energy**\nNow, let’s turn our attention to potential energy, a crucial component of mechanical energy. Potential\nenergy is the energy stored in an object due to its position or configuration. A classic example is a\nball placed atop a hill—its height confers potential energy, which can be converted into kinetic energy\nas it rolls down the hill.\nGrasping the conservation of energy is essential. This principle tells us that energy cannot be created\nor destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. As the ball rolls, its potential energy\ndiminishes, and kinetic energy increases. At the same time, the force of gravity acts upon the ball,\ndriving its descent and converting energy from one form to another.\nAnother instance is a stretched spring. The potential energy stored in the spring is due to its deformed\nstate. When released, this energy is transferred into kinetic energy as the spring unravels.\nThese examples illustrate how potential energy manifests and evolves. By exploring these principles,\nwe gain insights into energy efficiency and sustainability. Understanding these dynamics is vital for\ndeveloping systems that minimize energy waste and maximize output.\n27\n\nAs we proceed, think about applying these concepts to technological innovations. How can the\nprinciples of potential energy and conservation be harnessed to promote a more sustainable future?\nReflect on these possibilities as we delve deeper into the interplay of energy forms.\n**6. Potential Energy, Forces, and Work**\nLet’s delve into the connection between potential energy, forces, and work. Consider a mass m under\nthe influence of a force F = −kx, which is a spring force arising from a potential energy function\nU(x). The negative sign indicates that the force tends to reduce potential energy.\nNewton’s second law, F = ma = m¨x, describes the force as the mass times its acceleration. This\nequation reveals how forces influence the motion of objects, altering their kinetic energy.\nWhen a force acts over a distance, it performs work. The work W done by a force is given by\nW =\nR\nF(x) dx. In the case of a spring, the work performed equals the change in potential energy,\nW = −∆U.\nConservation of energy is pivotal. It states that the total energy, the sum of kinetic energy Ek and\npotential energy U, remains constant in the absence of external dissipative forces. Mathematically,\nEk + U = constant. This principle is fundamental in many areas of physics and engineering, as it\nallows us to analyze complex systems by tracking energy flow and conservation.\nReflect on how these principles can be applied to real-world scenarios, such as oscillating systems or\nmechanical devices. How can an understanding of forces and potential energy aid in designing more\nefficient systems? As we proceed, consider these applications and the broader implications for energy\nefficiency and sustainability.\n**7. Potential Energy and Vectors**\nNow, let’s delve into the role of vectors in potential energy and force expressions. When objects\nmove along a line, we use a one-dimensional vector, F = m¨x, to depict the force. This vector form\nemphasizes the direction and magnitude of the force acting on an object.\nIn two or three dimensions, we employ three-dimensional vectors to fully capture the force’s effect.\nA three-dimensional vector force is expressed as F = ma = m d2x\ndt2 = (m¨x, m¨y, m¨z).\nThe potential energy landscape varies in complexity with dimensions. For a system with a poten-\ntial energy function U(x, y, z), the force can be expressed as a gradient vector: F = −∇U =\n\u0010\n−∂U\n∂x , −∂U\n∂y , −∂U\n∂z\n\u0011\n.\nA key example is gravitational force, given by F = −∇U = −GMm\nr2\nˆr. This equation illustrates how\ngravity acts to decrease potential energy, always pointing towards the center of mass.\nUnderstanding vector representations of potential energy and forces allows us to analyze complex\nsystems, such as planetary orbits and mechanical structures. How can the principles of vector calculus\nand potential energy aid in solving real-world engineering challenges? Reflect on these applications\nas we continue to explore the connections between these mathematical concepts and their significance\nin physics and beyond.\n**8. Potential Energy: Applications**\nLet’s examine some practical applications of potential energy. Consider an airplane at high altitude.\nThe potential energy an airplane possesses is given by U = mgh, where m is the mass, g is the\nacceleration due to gravity, and h is the height. For a 747 traveling at 900 km/h, this potential energy\ncan reach an impressive 11 gigajoules at an altitude of 40,000 feet.\nPotential energy is equally important on a smaller scale. Take, for example, water pumps that lift\nwater uphill to storage tanks. This process converts electrical energy into potential energy, allowing\nthe water to be stored until needed. Similarly, elevators and cranes utilize potential energy to lift loads\nagainst gravity, showcasing the versatility of potential energy in both engineering and everyday life.\nThese examples highlight the significance of potential energy in both everyday applications and\nlarge-scale industrial processes. Understanding potential energy not only helps in appreciating the\nefficiency of various machines but also prompts us to think creatively about energy storage and\nutilization in new technologies.\nAs we proceed, consider how these principles can be applied to sustainable energy solutions. How\n28\n\ncan the understanding of potential energy contribute to developing more efficient energy systems?\nReflect on these possibilities as we continue to explore the dynamic interplay between energy forms\nand their applications in the world around us.\n**9. Back to the Road Trip**\nLet’s return to our road trip scenario, where we calculated an energy expenditure of 840 megajoules\nfor a 4000 lb car traveling at 60 mph from Boston to New York. Both cities are at sea level, so does\npotential energy play a role here?\nSurprisingly, even at sea level, potential energy is significant due to the road’s elevation profile. As\nyou travel, the road’s elevation changes can alter the car’s potential energy. Climbing a hill increases\npotential energy, while descending allows some energy recapture through kinetic energy.\nOn our typical road trip, minor elevation changes occur, particularly on highways like I-95, which\nhave noticeable elevation gains. These variations in elevation mean that potential energy is not just a\ntheoretical concept but a practical consideration in energy accounting.\nTaking potential energy into account can influence how we approach fuel efficiency. Understanding\nthese energy dynamics encourages us to think critically about optimizing vehicle efficiency and\nconsidering the natural landscape’s impact on energy use.\nAs we continue, think about how these principles can be applied to other real-world situations.\nHow can recognizing potential energy help us in everyday activities or in the design of efficient\ntransportation systems? Reflect on these possibilities and their potential to enhance our understanding\nof energy in the world around us.\n**10. Estimate Effects of Hills**\nWhen planning a road trip from Boston to New York, examining the impact of hills on energy use is\nessential. Even with a constant speed of 60 mph, elevation changes significantly affect a vehicle’s\nenergy consumption.\nEach mile gained in elevation requires approximately 50 feet of elevation gain. Assuming this\nscenario, 27 megajoules of energy are needed just to tackle the hills—this calculation is based on the\nenergy cost of climbing a hill, mgh, where m is the mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is\nthe height gained.\nThis energy is partly recovered when descending, but not entirely, due to friction and other losses.\nThus, some energy is recaptured on the way down, not all of it is regained.\nThe implications for energy use are noteworthy. Even minor hills can result in a substantial portion of\nthe total energy expenditure during a journey. This highlights the need to consider elevation changes\nwhen evaluating energy efficiency in driving.\nThese calculations encourage critical thinking about route planning and energy efficiency. As we\ndelve deeper into energy use in transportation, think about how overcoming hills affects overall fuel\nconsumption and what strategies could reduce this impact. How might engineering solutions or\ndriving habits be improved to address these challenges?\n**11. Air Resistance and Friction**\nDuring a road trip, dealing with air resistance is an inevitable challenge that hampers a car’s efficiency.\nAs a vehicle moves, it interacts with air molecules, creating resistance that reduces fuel efficiency.\nThis air resistance, or drag, is calculated using the formula ∆Eair = 1\n2cd(∆mair)v2, where cd is the\ndrag coefficient, ∆mair is the mass of air displaced, and v is the velocity of the vehicle.\nThe drag coefficient varies with a vehicle’s design; for typical cars, cd is approximately 1/3. This\nformula reveals that energy lost to air resistance is directly linked to the vehicle’s speed and the\ndensity of the air. At higher speeds, the energy loss escalates significantly.\nStreamlining a car’s design can substantially decrease this energy loss. By reducing the drag\ncoefficient and minimizing surface area, vehicles can cut down on air resistance and improve fuel\nefficiency. This principle is evident in the aerodynamic designs of modern vehicles.\nUnderstanding these dynamics not only highlights the importance of engineering in enhancing vehicle\nefficiency but also encourages us to think critically about optimizing energy use in transportation. As\nwe proceed, consider how these principles can be applied to create more sustainable transportation\n29\n\nmethods. How might these ideas influence the future of car design and other forms of travel? Reflect\non these possibilities and their potential to transform our approach to energy efficiency in the coming\nyears.\n**12. Total Energy Lost to Air Resistance**\nNow, let’s delve into the energy lost due to air resistance during a road trip from Boston to New York.\nUsing the formula derived earlier, Wair = 1\n2cd(AD)ρv2, we can estimate this energy loss.\nThe drag coefficient (cd) for a typical car is about 0.33. For a journey of 330 kilometers at a speed of\n27.7 meters per second, the total energy lost to air resistance is approximately 133 megajoules.\nBut how does this stack up with other energy expenditures during the trip? Consider that rolling\nresistance and hills each consume around 54 and 27 megajoules, respectively. Compared to the 210\nmegajoules total energy available from the gasoline burned, a significant portion is attributed to air\nresistance.\nThis analysis highlights the importance of reducing air resistance to enhance fuel efficiency. Stream-\nlining a car’s design, increasing tire pressure, and maintaining a moderate speed can mitigate this\nenergy loss.\nExploring these strategies offers promising avenues to optimize vehicle efficiency. As we wrap up\nthis lecture, think about how these insights might be applied to real-world transportation challenges.\nHow can we harness these principles to foster more sustainable travel options? Reflect on these\npossibilities and their potential to transform our approach to energy efficiency in the years ahead.\n**13. Final Energy Accounting**\nLet’s recap the various energy expenditures during our hypothetical road trip from Boston to New\nYork. We began by accounting for kinetic energy, estimating about 2 megajoules necessary for\nmaintaining speed and managing stoplights.\nAdding to this, the energy required to conquer hills amounts to around 27 megajoules, considering\nan average elevation gain of 50 feet per mile. Rolling resistance also claims approximately 54\nmegajoules, emulating a 1% grade, while air resistance incurs a substantial 133 megajoules, assuming\na constant speed of 60 mph.\nThe total energy usage for this journey is roughly 216 megajoules. It’s crucial to recognize that these\ncalculations are based on a 25% efficient internal combustion engine, with 840 megajoules of gasoline\nenergy consumed during a 330 km trip.\nThis energy accounting highlights the impact of various factors on fuel efficiency. It directs our\nattention to optimization possibilities, such as enhancing engine efficiency, reducing air resistance,\nand exploring alternative propulsion systems.\nAs we analyze city driving conditions, which are heavily influenced by acceleration, rolling resistance,\nand stoplights, we must consider how these elements differ from long highway trips. City driving\ntends to consume more energy due to frequent stopping and starting.\nThis examination of energy use in transportation prompts us to contemplate future innovations. How\ncan we refine our approach to energy efficiency in vehicles? Reflect on these potential advancements\nand their possible transformation of our relationship with energy.\n**14. Reducing Transport Energy Costs**\nNow, let’s explore how to cut down on transport energy costs. A key piece of advice is to drive at\nlower speeds, as air resistance (Wair) is proportional to the square of the speed. Thus, choosing a\nspeed of 60 mph instead of 80 mph can significantly cut down on energy use.\nDesigning vehicles to be more streamlined is another effective strategy. By reducing the drag\ncoefficient (cd) and the vehicle’s cross-sectional area (A), we can greatly lessen air resistance.\nAdditionally, mass transit systems offer a sustainable solution by carrying more passengers, thereby\nreducing the energy required per person.\nProper tire inflation is often overlooked but is crucial for reducing rolling resistance. Ensuring tires\nare adequately inflated can enhance fuel efficiency by decreasing the force needed to roll the tires.\nModern engines, like those in Toyota hybrids, also play a vital role. They optimize the energy used\nduring acceleration and deceleration, improving overall efficiency. Regenerative braking systems are\n30\n\nanother feature that capture energy during braking, storing it for future use.\nLooking to the future, technologies such as vacuum tunnels and space-based railways offer theoreti-\ncally near-zero energy solutions. Although not yet practical, these concepts hold promise for future\ntransportation.\nImplementing these strategies can lead to substantial energy cost reductions and a more sustainable\nfuture. As you consider these ideas, think about their application in your daily life. How can you\ncontribute to energy efficiency in transportation? Reflect on these possibilities and their potential to\ntransform our approach to energy use in the years ahead.\n**15.
