Agentic AI has\nemerged as a key paradigm for intelligent communications\nand networking, enabling AI-driven agents to perceive, rea-\nson, decide, and act within dynamic networking environments.\nHowever, effective decision-making in telecom applications, such\nas network planning, management, and resource allocation,\nrequires integrating retrieval mechanisms that support multi-\nhop reasoning, historical cross-referencing, and compliance with\nevolving 3GPP standards. This article presents a forward-looking\nperspective on generative information retrieval-inspired intelli-\ngent communications and networking, emphasizing the role of\nknowledge acquisition, processing, and retrieval in agentic AI\nfor telecom systems. We first provide a comprehensive review of\ngenerative information retrieval strategies, including traditional\nretrieval, hybrid retrieval, semantic retrieval, knowledge-based\nretrieval, and agentic contextual retrieval. We then analyze their\nadvantages, limitations, and suitability for various networking\nscenarios. Next, we present a survey about their applications\nin communications and networking. Additionally, we introduce\nan agentic contextual retrieval framework to enhance telecom-\nspecific planning by integrating multi-source retrieval, structured\nreasoning, and self-reflective validation. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our framework significantly improves answer\naccuracy, explanation consistency, and retrieval efficiency com-\npared to traditional and semantic retrieval methods. Finally, we\noutline future research directions.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAccording to a Cisco report, the number of connected\ndevices is expected to surpass 125 billion by 20301, re-\nquiring networking systems to process massive amounts of\ndata while maintaining seamless interactions across diverse,\nheterogeneous infrastructures.

Agentic AI has\nemerged as a promising paradigm for autonomous network\nintelligence, addressing the limitations of traditional rule-\nbased and static AI architectures. Introduced by OpenAI2,\nDeepSeek3, and other research institutions, agentic AI refers\nto autonomous agents that can perceive, reason, act, and\ncontinuously learn from their environments, allowing them\nto dynamically optimize network configurations, manage re-\nsources, and mitigate failures in large-scale systems [2]. Un-\nlike conventional AI, which operates on fixed rules or pre-\ntrained models, agentic AI leverages large language models\n(LLMs), generative AI-based decision-making, and multi-\nembodied AI agent collaboration to facilitate self-organizing,\nhighly adaptive network architectures [3]. For example, in\n[4], the authors explored intent-based networking with agentic\nAI, where autonomous agents dynamically updated network\nmanagement policies based on user-defined intents, achiev-\ning a 32% improvement in QoS requirements and a 40%\nreduction in manual intervention for network reconfiguration.\nDespite its potential, agentic AI faces critical limitations,\nparticularly in handling large-scale network data, maintain-\ning long-term memory, and retrieving historical insights for\nenhanced decision-making. Specifically, LLM-based agents\noften lack efficient information retrieval methods, resulting\nin hallucinations, context drift, and response inconsistency,\nwhich undermine their reliability in real-world networking\napplications.\nTo mitigate these limitations, generative information re-\ntrieval has been proposed as a fundamental enhancement for\nagentic AI-driven network intelligence [5]. Unlike traditional\nretrieval techniques, which rely on static keyword searches and\nlimited contextual matching, generative information retrieval\ndynamically retrieves, synthesizes, and integrates multi-source\nknowledge, enabling memory-augmented, context-aware rea-\nsoning. For instance, in real-world networking applications,\nretrieval-augmented AI systems can access historical network\nlogs, regulatory standards, and prior optimization strategies,\nallowing them to infer multi-hop dependencies across diverse\nnetwork data sources [6]. This approach significantly enhances\ndecision accuracy, adaptability, and long-term contextual un-\nderstanding.

Overview of key retrieval strategies in networking. The figure highlights the methodologies, key components, and applications of different approaches,\nincluding traditional retrieval, hybrid retrieval, semantic retrieval, knowledge-based retrieval, and agentic contextual retrieval.\npractice is Meta AI’s LlamaIndex4, which enables structured\ndocument retrieval for LLM-based applications. It allows AI\nagents to process and integrate domain-specific knowledge in\nreal-time.\nBuilding on these foundations, this article provides a\nforward-looking perspective on agentic contextual retrieval\nand its role in enhancing information retrieval and decision-\nmaking within 3GPP-driven autonomous networking envi-\nronments. Unlike conventional retrieval-augmented AI frame-\nworks, the proposed approach integrates multi-source retrieval,\nstructured reasoning, and self-reflective validation, thereby\nensuring improved retrieval accuracy, contextual coherence,\nand decision consistency. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first work to explore the potential of agentic contextual\nretrieval for 3GPP-based telecommunications troubleshooting\nand real-time standard-compliant decision-making. The key\ncontributions of this work are summarized as follows.\nFirstly, we summarize different retrieval strategies, includ-\ning traditional retrieval, hybrid retrieval, semantic retrieval,\nknowledge-based retrieval, and demonstrate the most advanced\nagentic contextual retrieval. We analyze their applications in\nnetworking environments, identifying key challenges and the\nrole of retrieval in enhancing network intelligence. Secondly,\nwe provide a comprehensive review of retrieval-based method-\nologies in networking and communications, categorizing ex-\nisting works based on their scenarios, proposed techniques,\nand publication timelines. This analysis highlights research\ntrends and the evolving role of retrieval in intelligent com-\nmunications and networking. Finally, we introduce an LLM-\nbased framework that integrates agentic contextual retrieval\nto improve telecom-specific planning and decision-making.\nThis framework incorporates multi-source knowledge retrieval,\nreasoning-based decision augmentation, and contextual adap-\ntation, leading to substantial improvements in network opti-\nmization, fault diagnosis, and adaptive policy enforcement.\nII. DIFFERENT RETRIEVAL METHODS FOR NETWORKING\nIn intelligent networking, retrieval systems help process vast\namounts of unstructured data, optimize spectrum usage, and\n4https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\nsupport AI-based network controllers [5]. In edge intelligence,\nretrieval techniques facilitate distributed learning, enhance\nfederated AI models, and provide real-time recommendations\nwith minimal latency. As shown in Fig 1, retrieval methods\nhave evolved from traditional keyword-based approaches to\nhybrid and context-aware techniques, each addressing specific\nchallenges in networking environments.\nA. Traditional Information Retrieval\nTraditional information retrieval is based on matching query\nterms with exact keywords in the dataset, often using simple\nyet effective algorithms such as Boolean matching or vector\nspace models. These methods calculate document relevance by\nscoring terms according to their frequency within a document\n(i.e., term frequency, TF) and across the entire dataset (i.e.,\ninverse document frequency, IDF). The resulting relevance\nscores rank documents based on their alignment with the\nquery. This approach works well in structured datasets with\nclear and consistent keyword distributions, such as early\nlibrary catalog systems or archival searches. However, it\ndoes not account for the semantic meaning of terms or the\nbroader context in which the query occurs. To address such\nissues, for example, Salton et al. [7] proposed a foundational\nvector space model where documents and queries are repre-\nsented as vectors in a multi-dimensional space. The similarity\nbetween these vectors is computed using cosine similarity,\nallowing for efficient ranking of documents based on query\nrelevance. Experimental results demonstrated that the vector\nspace model improved retrieval precision by 15% compared\nto basic Boolean retrieval methods. However, when applied to\ndynamic datasets such as network resource management logs,\nits reliance on exact matches caused about a 20% drop in\nrecall for queries involving synonyms or contextually related\nterms. These limitations highlight the need for more adaptive\nretrieval methods in real-time scenarios.\nB. Hybrid Retrieval\nHybrid retrieval combines traditional retrieval methods, such\nas TF-IDF scoring, with semantic embeddings generated by\n\n3\nTABLE I\nCOMPARISON OF KEY RETRIEVAL STRATEGIES.\nRetrieval methods\nTraining strategies\nApplicable network types\nUser demands\nAgentic AI applications\nApplication examples\nTraditional  \nInformation retrieval\nBased on explicit keyword matching \nor Boolean logic. \nWorks well in relatively static \nnetworks or environments [6].\nFocused on delivering relevant \nresults based on exact keyword \nmatches\nLimited agent-based \napplications but can be used in \nsimple chatbot systems.\nElasticsearch\n(https://github.com/elastic/elastics\nearch)\nApache Lucene\n(https://github.com/apache/lucene)\nHybrid retrieval\nCombines traditional keyword-based \nretrieval and machine learning models \n(e.g., TF-IDF and BERT) .\nWorks well in dynamic \nenvironments where content is \nconstantly changing, and user \npreferences need to be understood \n[7].\nUsers demand a more refined \nsearch experience where results \nare also tailored to personal \npreferences.\nChatbots and \nrecommendation systems use \nhybrid retrieval to suggest \nproducts, content, or responses.\nRecommendation System\n(https://github.com/lyst/lightfm)\nNixiesearch\n(https://github.com/nixiesearch/nixi\nesearch)\nSemantic retrieval\nUses deep learning (e.g., word \nembeddings like Word2Vec and BERT, \netc.) to understand the meaning behind \nthe query and the documents.\nWorks well in environments where \nunderstanding context is important \n[8].\nUsers demand results that \nunderstand the intent behind \ntheir queries rather than just \nkeyword matches.\nWidely used in AI agents like \nvirtual assistants (Google \nAssistant, Siri), or knowledge-\nbased agents.\nSemantic Search Engine\n(https://github.com/deepset-\nai/haystack)\nTxtai\n(https://github.com/neuml/txtai)\nKnowledge-based \nretrieval\nUses rule-based approaches and \ninference engines to retrieve relevant \ninformation based on predefined \nknowledge structures.\nPrimarily used in static or semi-\nstatic networks, where domain \nknowledge remains relatively constant \nbut is highly structured [9].\nUsers expect highly accurate, \nfactual, and structured \ninformation based on established \nknowledge.\nAI agents can act as expert \nconsultants in areas like \nhealthcare (e.g., IBM Watson) or \nlegal systems.\nKnowledge Graph Search\n(https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j)\nSciTLDR\n(https://github.com/allenai/scitldr)\nAgentic contextual \nretrieval\nMethods like Reinforcement Learning \n(RLHF) for adaptive retrieval or meta-\nlearning for fast adaption.\nWorks well in multi-agent and \ndynamic environments where \ncontext is constantly evolving [10].\nUsers expect adaptive and \npersonalized retrieval based on \nevolving queries.\nUsed in autonomous AI \nassistants (ChatGPT Agents, \nClaude, Google Gemini).\nAI-Powered Coding Assistants\n(https://github.com/features/copilot)\nModelScope-Agent\n(https://github.com/modelscope/m\nodelscope-agent)\npre-trained deep learning models such as BERT or GPT. This\nhybrid approach addresses the limitations of traditional meth-\nods by incorporating contextual understanding while maintain-\ning computational efficiency. In hybrid retrieval, the process\ntypically contains two stages: a coarse filtering stage, which\nuses lightweight traditional methods to identify a subset of\ncandidate documents, followed by a re-ranking stage where\nsemantic embeddings are applied to refine results. This two-\nstage approach ensures that hybrid retrieval is both efficient\nand accurate, making it particularly suitable for environments\nwhere computational resources are limited but semantic depth\nis required. In networking applications, hybrid retrieval can\nbe particularly useful for AI-driven network monitoring and\nanomaly detection, where efficient pre-filtering combined with\ndeep learning enables fast yet context-aware decision-making.\nFor example, Zeng et al. [8] proposed a federated hybrid\nretrieval framework designed to integrate traditional TF-IDF\nfiltering with semantic re-ranking using BERT embeddings.\nTheir system processed candidate documents in two stages:\nfirst, TF-IDF was used to rapidly filter out irrelevant data at\nmobile edge nodes, significantly reducing the search space;\nsecond, the filtered candidates were semantically ranked using\nembeddings. Experimental results showed that this approach\nimproved retrieval precision by 25% and reduced computa-\ntional latency by 20% compared to other classical retrieval\nsystems.\nC. Semantic Retrieval\nSemantic retrieval uses deep neural networks, particularly\ntransformer-based architectures such as BERT, to encode\nqueries and documents into a shared embedding space. This\nembedding space captures the semantic relationships between\nterms, enabling the retrieval system to understand the intent\nbehind the query rather than relying solely on exact key-\nword matches. Semantic retrieval excels in handling complex\nqueries that involve ambiguous or domain-specific language,\nsuch as medical diagnostics and network troubleshooting.\nFor example, Tang et al. [9] proposed a semantic retrieval\nframework leveraging BERT-based embeddings to optimize\nresource allocation in wireless networks. By encoding queries\nand documents into a shared semantic space, the system\nretrieved contextually related documents even for complex\nqueries such as “dynamic spectrum sharing in 5G\". Their\nexperiments demonstrated a 32% increase in recall compared\nto hybrid retrieval methods and an 18% improvement in\nprecision.\nD. Knowledge-Based Retrieval\nKnowledge-based retrieval integrates domain-specific on-\ntologies and structured knowledge graphs to enhance retrieval\nperformance. These systems excel in reasoning tasks by ex-\nplicitly leveraging predefined relationships between entities,\nproviding interpretable results that are often critical in reg-\nulated domains such as healthcare, finance, and telecommu-\nnications. In knowledge-based retrieval, it is performed by\nquerying the knowledge graph to extract entities and their\nrelationships that match the query context. This method allows\nfor reasoning over linked data, enabling the retrieval of not\njust relevant documents but also actionable insights based\non the relationships in the dataset. For example, Xiong et\nal. [10] proposed a knowledge graph-based retrieval system\nfor wireless spectrum management. Their framework utilized\na graph structure where nodes represented entities such as\n“spectrum bands,” “user demands,” and “interference levels,”\nwhile edges captured relationships such as “interferes with” or\n“assigned to.” The key advantage of this approach lies in its\nability to provide structured, explainable decisions based on\npredefined rules. The system achieved a 25% improvement\nin spectrum allocation efficiency and a 30% reduction in\ninterference conflicts compared to heuristic-based methods.\nE.

Un-\nlike traditional or semantic retrieval methods, which rely on\nstatic queries and predefined indexing, this approach enables\nadaptive, goal-driven information extraction that continuously\nrefines itself based on evolving conditions. By incorporating\nreal-time system states, historical patterns, and structured\nknowledge representations, agentic contextual retrieval ensures\nhigh adaptability and context-aware decision-making, making\nit particularly suited for applications in network optimiza-\ntion, autonomous systems, and intelligent fault diagnostics.\nA key advantage of agentic contextual retrieval is its ability\nto enable autonomous decision-making agents that actively\nmonitor, retrieve, and reason over multiple data sources to\nenhance performance in complex, dynamic environments. For\nexample, Kagaya et al. [11] proposed a retrieval framework for\nautonomous driving, where an agent-driven control mechanism\nintegrated LiDAR, GPS, real-time traffic updates, and weather\nconditions to dynamically adjust navigation strategies. By en-\nabling real-time, intelligent retrieval and control, their system\nreduced recalibration time by 40% and improved navigation\naccuracy by 28%.\nF. Retrieval Comparison and Lessons Learned\nRetrieval methods vary significantly in their methodolo-\ngies, applications, and suitability for different networking\nscenarios. Specifically, traditional retrieval, which relies on\nexplicit keyword matching, is well-suited for static local\nnetwork management, where queries are simple, computational\nresources are limited, and speed is prioritized. Hybrid retrieval\ncombines keyword-based search with machine learning mod-\nels, making it effective for dynamic network environments,\nsuch as adaptive caching or content distribution, where user\npreferences evolve over time. Semantic retrieval, powered by\ndeep learning models, enhances intent-driven network diagnos-\ntics by capturing query context, making it particularly useful\nfor automated fault detection and troubleshooting in telecom\nnetworks. Knowledge-based retrieval, leveraging structured\ninference models, supports rule-based network security and\naccess control, where highly accurate, structured decision-\nmaking is critical. Finally, agentic contextual retrieval offers\nadaptive and real-time decision support in multi-agent network\ncontrol systems, where dynamic environmental factors, such\nas interference levels or traffic congestion, require continu-\nous learning and adjustment [11]. Table I summarizes these\nstrategies, highlighting their core features, training methods,\nand example applications.\nMoreover, we conduct a review of recent retrieval-based\napproaches in communications and networking from 2023\nto late 2024, as summarized in Fig. 2. Our analysis cat-\negorizes retrieval strategies into traditional, hybrid, seman-\ntic, knowledge-based, and agentic contextual retrieval, high-\nlighting their applications across various domains, including\nwireless communications, network optimization, and intel-\nligent decision-making. While retrieval-augmented methods\nhave been increasingly integrated into AI-driven network re-\nsource management and semantic communication, we observe\nthat agentic contextual retrieval remains largely unexplored\nfor telecommunications-specific applications. Moreover, while\n[11] demonstrates agentic contextual retrieval for autonomous\ndriving control, there is currently no direct implementation tai-\nlored for communication networks and telecom infrastructure.\nTo fill this gap, the next section introduces our proposed frame-\nwork, which leverages agentic contextual retrieval to enhance\nintelligent decision-making, troubleshooting, and autonomous\nadaptation in telecommunications and networking systems.\nIII.

However, this paradigm introduces signifi-\ncant challenges in bridging the gap between user intents,\nstructured communication standards, and real-time network\n\n5\n• Build a FAISS10 index\nWhat is the role of the serving network in fraud control?\nA: To process charging information in real time\nB: To collect charging information from network elements\nC: To handle cost control mechanisms\nD: To meter charge flows independently\nUser\nPrompt\nClustering\nSplitting\nMpnet-base-V29\n• Load documents from \ndatabase \n• Mpnet-base-V29 \nembedding model\nA.

Illustration of the agentic contextual retrieval enhanced intelligent base station for troubleshooting and decision-making. The framework follows a\nstructured four-step workflow: (A) Query understanding and reformulation ensure alignment with 3GPP terminology using LLM-based query expansion. (B)\nMulti-source knowledge retrieval extracts relevant information from both structured (e.g., 3GPP standards) and unstructured (e.g., online sources) datasets.\n(C) Contextual evidence aggregation and reasoning synthesize retrieved knowledge into structured responses using chain-of-thought reasoning. (D) Decision-\nmaking and self-validation enhance accuracy through confidence-based verification and iterative refinement, reducing hallucinations and improving response\nconsistency.\nconfigurations. A key challenge lies in mapping natural lan-\nguage intent descriptions to actionable network configura-\ntions, requiring an understanding of both human semantics\nand telecommunications-specific knowledge. Traditional rule-\nbased methods or static intent templates are insufficient in\nhandling diverse user demands and evolving network con-\nditions [4]. LLMs offer a promising solution due to their\nstrong natural language understanding (NLU) and reasoning\ncapabilities. However, LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge\nin telecommunications, such as 3GPP standards, intent transla-\ntion templates, and network control logic. Consequently, their\ndirect application to network automation remains limited by\nknowledge incompleteness, retrieval inefficiency, and contex-\ntual inconsistency.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a retrieval-\nenhanced intelligent base station architecture, where the net-\nwork dynamically retrieves, synthesizes, and applies knowl-\nedge from 3GPP standards, network logs, and external tele-\ncom repositories to enhance decision-making. Specifically,\nthe system employs a hybrid retrieval framework to convert\nuser-generated intents into structured network actions, using\na template-based approach that aligns with communication\nparadigms outlined in 3GPP [12]. In this framework, user\nrequests (e.g., “I need ultra-low latency for cloud gaming”)\nare processed by the network’s AI module, which retrieves\nrelevant telecom policies and configurations before generat-\ning a customized communication plan. Despite the advan-\ntages of retrieval-augmented LLMs, conventional retrieval-\naugmented generation (RAG) techniques face critical limita-\ntions in telecom-specific applications, including: (i) Contex-\ntual Ambiguity: Simple keyword-based retrieval struggles to\nretrieve relevant 3GPP policies and network parameters, as\nuser intents often involve multiple layers of contextual in-\nterpretation. (ii) Data Sparsity: Telecommunications standards\nand policy documents are highly structured, yet spread across\nmultiple releases and fragmented into different standardization\ndocuments. (iii) Retrieval Inefficiency: Traditional retrieval\napproaches lack multi-hop reasoning, failing to link user\nintents with both historical network behavior and real-time\nconditions.\nTo overcome these limitations, we introduce an agentic\ncontextual retrieval framework, which integrates multi-source\nknowledge retrieval, structured reasoning, and self-reflective\nvalidation to enhance intent-driven networking. Our frame-\nwork enables intelligent base stations to map user intents to\nnetwork configurations in real-time, leveraging LLM-powered\ndecision-making while ensuring alignment with 3GPP com-\npliance, traffic optimization strategies, and real-world deploy-\nment policies.\nB. Agentic Contextual Retrieval Framework\nAs shown in Fig. 3, the deployment of the agentic contextual\nretrieval framework follows a structured four-step workflow,\ndesigned to enhance the retrieval, reasoning, and validation of\nknowledge specific to 3GPP standards and telecommunications\nnetworks.\n1) Knowledge Preparation and Query Understanding:\nThe system first loads 3GPP standards and network doc-\numentation from a database, segments them into context-\naware knowledge chunks, and vectorizes them using sentence-\ntransformer embeddings. To enable efficient semantic retrieval,\nthe vectorized knowledge chunks are indexed using a vector\ndatabase, allowing for efficient similarity searches. After that,\nonce a query is received, the system analyzes user intent and\nperforms query reformulation, ensuring that the query aligns\nwith 3GPP-defined communication paradigms and technical\nconfigurations. In practice, telecommunications queries often\ncontain ambiguous terms, incomplete phrasing, or require\nhistorical cross-referencing across multiple 3GPP releases.\nTherefore, it is necessary to fully understand the user intent\nand the key concepts in this context to improve retrieval\naccuracy. Specifically, we can use LLMs to realize that and\nensure longitudinal consistency when retrieving regulatory and\ntechnical specifications [13]. In our experimental setup, user\n\n6\nAnswer matching accuracy (%)\nAnswer text \nF1 score (%)\nExplanation Avg.\nBERT Score (%) \nExplanation Avg.\nCosine Similarity (%)\n84\n90.95\n80.83\n90.37\n70\n82.2\n74.51\n87.35\n100\n100\n100\n100\nAnswer matching accuracy (%)\nAnswer text \nF1 score (%)\nExplanation Avg.\nBERT Score (%) \nExplanation Avg.\nCosine Similarity (%)\n84\n90.95\n80.83\n90.37\n74\n82.07\n80.86\n88.52\n100\n100\n100\n100\nAnswer matching accuracy (%)\nAnswer text \nF1 score (%)\nExplanation Avg.\nBERT Score (%) \nExplanation Avg.\nCosine Similarity (%)\n84\n90.95\n80.83\n90.37\n80\n88.24\n81,84\n88.84\n100\n100\n100\n100\nAgentic Contextual Retrieval \nQWen-Max\nQWen-Max (RAG) with Traditional Retriever\nQWen-Max (RAG) with Semantic Retriever\nFig. 4. Performance comparison of Agentic Contextual Retrieval against baseline methods, including QWen-Max without retriever, traditional retrieval, and\nsemantic retrieval.\nintent queries, such as customized communication service\nrequests (e.g., “I need ultra-reliable low-latency communica-\ntion for industrial automation”), are first parsed and the key\nconcepts such as “ultra-reliable low-latency”, “role of URLLC\nin industrial automation” are extracted.\n2) Multi-Source Knowledge Retrieval: Following query\noptimization, the second step involves multi-source retrieval\nto ensure both completeness and relevance in decision-making\nfor network configuration and policy enforcement. Next, we\nintegrate semantic vector-based retrieval with embedding mod-\nels to extract key information from 3GPP specifications,\nnetwork operation policies, and real-time telecom deployment\nscenarios. Embedding models generate dense vector represen-\ntations of text, enabling context-aware similarity search rather\nthan relying on exact keyword matches [14]. To further im-\nprove accuracy, structured knowledge representations establish\nrelationships between frequency bands, protocol parameters,\nand QoS metrics, refining query precision. Additionally, real-\ntime retrieval from online repositories ensures access to the\nlatest standardization updates. For instance, when retrieving\ninformation on \"5G network slicing SLA guarantees,\" the\nsystem uses an embedding model to identify semantically\nrelevant sections from TS 28.531 (Performance Assurance)\nand TS 28.554 (KPI Definitions) while incorporating recent\ncase studies from network operators.\n3) Contextual Evidence Aggregation and Reasoning:\nOnce relevant information is retrieved, the third step focuses\non contextual evidence aggregation and reasoning, where\nmulti-source knowledge is condensed into a structured and\ninterpretable response. Given the vast amount of information\navailable in telecom standardization, it is crucial to eliminate\nredundancy, enhance clarity, and ensure that the extracted con-\ntent directly addresses the query [13]. Specifically, we use an\nLLM-powered reasoning agent, which autonomously identifies\nthe most relevant text segments in the retrieved content based\non the reformulated query. The agent then synthesizes these\nsegments into a concise, context-aware summary, ensuring that\nonly the most important evidence is retained, and irrelevant or\nredundant information is discarded. For example, in response\nto a question like “What is the role of the serving network in\nfraud control?”, the retrieved information may contain detailed\ndescriptions of charging functions, fraud detection, and policy\nenforcement. Instead of presenting all these details, the agent\nanalyzes the content, extracts the core function of the serving\nnetwork in fraud prevention, and generates a concise summary,\nemphasizing its role in real-time data collection and cost\ncontrol.\n4) Decision-Making and Self-Validation: The final step in-\nvolves a decision-making agent that simultaneously generates\nboth the network action recommendations and justifications\nbased on the optimized query and refined retrieval results.\nThis agent applies CoT reasoning to synthesize a structured\nresponse, ensuring that the explanation logically supports\nthe answer by drawing from the retrieved evidence [15].\nTo enhance reliability, a self-reflection agent evaluates the\ngenerated response, critically reviewing both the answer and\nexplanation for consistency, factual accuracy, and alignment\nwith authoritative 3GPP standards. If inconsistencies, incom-\nplete reasoning, or speculative conclusions are detected, the\nself-reflection agent challenges the response and triggers an\niterative refinement loop.\nC. Simulation\nSimulation Settings: Our simulation is conducted using a\nstructured retrieval and reasoning pipeline, integrating multi-\nple knowledge sources and agent-driven query optimization.\nWe employ Qwen2.5-Max5 as the base LLM, leveraging its\nadvanced reasoning capabilities for telecom-related question-\nanswering tasks. To evaluate retrieval performance, we se-\nlected 50 structured QA pairs related to 3GPP R18 from the\nTeleQnA dataset, which serves as the primary benchmark. For\nadditional technical context, we use the 3GPP R18 dataset6.\nTo ensure retrieval efficiency, we utilize FAISS7, an indexing\ntool optimized for high-speed vector similarity search. The\ndocument processing workflow involves segmenting 3GPP\nstandard documents into 1000-character chunks with a 100-\ncharacter overlap, followed by embedding generation using\nMpnet-base-V28, a transformer-based model trained for dense\nvector representations. To evaluate the effectiveness of the\nproposed Agentic contextual retrieval framework, we com-\npare its performance against three baselines: (i) Qwen-Max\n5https://huggingface.co/spaces/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Max-Demo\n6https://huggingface.co/datasets/netop/3GPP-R18\n7https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss\n8https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2\n\n7\nwithout Retriever, representing a pure LLM-based approach,\n(ii) Qwen-Max with Traditional Retriever, utilizing stan-\ndard retrieval-based augmentation, and (iii) Qwen-Max with\nSemantic Retriever, incorporating semantic embedding-based\nretrieval. The comparison is conducted across four key evalu-\nation metrics, i.e., Answer Matching Accuracy, Answer Text\nF1 Score, Explanation BERT Score, and Explanation Cosine\nSimilarity, as shown in Fig. 4.\nFig. 4 demonstrates that Agentic contextual retrieval consis-\ntently outperforms all baseline methods across all evaluation\nmetrics. In particular, the proposed framework achieves an\nanswer matching accuracy of 84% and an answer text F1 score\nof 90.37%, surpassing the performance of semantic retrieval\n(i.e., 80%) and traditional retrieval (i.e., 74%), underscoring\nits effectiveness in generating precise and contextually relevant\nresponses. This improvement is attributed to its dynamic multi-\nsource retrieval, which integrates structured 3GPP standards\nwith external knowledge repositories, query reformulation\nmechanisms, ensuring alignment with telecom-specific termi-\nnology, and a structured reasoning pipeline, which employs\nCoT decision-making and self-validation loops to enhance\nlogical consistency and factual accuracy. Moreover, unlike\nconventional retrieval methods that rely on static document\nmatching, Agentic contextual retrieval dynamically extracts,\nsynthesizes, and validates multi-hop contextual information,\nsignificantly enhancing retrieval precision and response co-\nherence. Furthermore, the explanation quality also benefits\nsignificantly from our approach, as evidenced by the Ex-\nplanation BERT Score (i.e., 90.95%) and Cosine Similarity\n(i.e., 80.83%), both of which outperform alternative retrieval\nmethods. These improvements stem from the framework’s\nability to synthesize multi-source knowledge, apply struc-\ntured reasoning, and iteratively refine responses through self-\nreflection mechanisms. In contrast, the semantic retrieval\nbaseline, while effective at contextual retrieval, lacks robust\nreasoning capabilities and multi-turn validation, limiting its\nability to handle complex telecom-specific queries.\nIV. FUTURE DIRECTIONS\nSecurity and Privacy in Retrieval-Augmented Networks:\nAs agentic contextual retrieval frameworks increasingly rely\non multi-source knowledge retrieval, ensuring data integrity,\nconfidentiality, and adversarial robustness is critical. Future re-\nsearch should explore privacy-preserving retrieval techniques,\nsuch as federated retrieval, secure multi-party computation,\nand differential privacy-enhanced retrieval models, to mitigate\nrisks associated with unauthorized data access and adversarial\nattacks in wireless and networking applications.\nEnergy-Efficient and Low-Latency Retrieval Network-\ning Architectures: Deploying LLM-driven agentic contextual\nretrieval frameworks in real-world wireless and networking\nenvironments requires optimized inference efficiency and low-\nlatency retrieval mechanisms. Future studies could investigate\nmobile device-aware retrieval strategies, knowledge distillation\nfor lightweight retrieval models, and edge-based retrieval de-\nployment to minimize computational overhead while maintain-\ning retrieval accuracy in resource-constrained environments,\nsuch as 5G edge nodes and IoT devices.\nNetwork-Aware Adaptive Retrieval for Real-Time Op-\ntimization: As telecom networks become increasingly com-\nplex and dynamic, retrieval systems must not only process\nknowledge efficiently but also adapt to real-time network\nconditions, congestion levels, and QoS constraints. Future\nresearch should explore network-aware retrieval architectures\nthat dynamically adjust retrieval latency, query granularity,\nand resource allocation based on real-time network traffic and\ntopology changes. Techniques such as reinforcement learning-\nbased retrieval scheduling, adaptive caching, and traffic-aware\nretrieval pipelines could significantly enhance the responsive-\nness and efficiency in networking environments.\nV.
