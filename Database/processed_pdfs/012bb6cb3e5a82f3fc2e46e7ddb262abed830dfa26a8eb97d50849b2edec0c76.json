The loss of\neither modality significantly degrades performance. Inspired by this multisensory integration, prior object\npose estimation research has attempted to combine visual and haptic/tactile feedback. Although these works\ndemonstrate improvements in controlled environments or synthetic datasets, they often underperform vision-\nonly approaches in real-world settings due to poor generalization across diverse grippers, sensor layouts, or\nsim-to-real environments. Furthermore, they typically estimate the object pose for each frame independently,\nresulting in less coherent tracking over sequences in real-world deployments. To address these limitations,\nwe introduce a novel unified haptic representation that effectively handles multiple gripper embodiments.\nBuilding on this representation, we introduce a new visuo-haptic transformer-based object pose tracker that\nseamlessly integrates visual and haptic input. We validate our framework in our dataset and the Feelsight dataset,\ndemonstrating significant performance improvement on challenging sequences. Notably, our method achieves\nsuperior generalization and robustness across novel embodiments, objects, and sensor types (both taxel-based\nand vision-based tactile sensors). In real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms\nstate-of-the-art visual trackers by a large margin. We further show that we can achieve precise manipulation\ntasks by incorporating our real-time object tracking result into motion plans, underscoring the advantages of\nvisuo-haptic perception. Our model and dataset will be made open source upon acceptance of the paper. Project\nwebsite https://lhy.xyz/projects/v-hop/\n1. Introduction\nAccurately tracking object poses is a core capability\nfor robotic manipulation, and would enable contact-\nrich and dexterous manipulations with efficient im-\nitation or reinforcement learning (Wen et al., 2022;\nLi et al., 2024a; Hsu et al., 2024). Recent state-\nof-the-art object pose estimation methods, such as\nFoundationPose (Wen et al., 2024), have significantly\nadvanced visual tracking by leveraging large-scale\ndatasets. However, relying solely on visual informa-\ntion to perceive objects can be challenging, particu-\nlarly in contact-rich or in-hand manipulation scenar-\nios involving high occlusion and rapid dynamics.\nThe cognitive science findings show that hu-\nmans naturally integrate visual and haptic informa-\ntion for robust object perception during manipula-\ntion (Navarro-Guerrero et al., 2023; Ernst and Banks,\n2002; Lacey and Sathian, 2020). For instance, Gor-\ndon et al. (1991) demonstrated that humans use vi-\nsion to hypothesize object properties and haptics to\nrefine precision grasps. The human “sense of touch”\nconsists of two distinct senses (Loomis and Led-\nerman, 1986; Dahiya et al., 2010): the cutaneous\nsense, which detects stimulation on the skin sur-\nface, and kinesthesis, which provides information\nFigure 1: Visuo-haptic sensing for 6D object pose track-\ning. We fuse egocentric visual and haptic sensing to\nachieve accurate real-time in-hand object tracking.\non static and dynamic body posture. This integration,\nknown as haptic perception, allows humans to ef-\nfectively perceive and manipulate objects (Lacey and\nSathian, 2020). In robotics, analogous capabilities\nare achieved through tactile sensors (cutaneous sense)\nand joint sensors (kinesthesis) (Navarro-Guerrero\net al., 2023).\nCorresponding author: Hongyu Li (hli230@cs.brown.edu)\narXiv:2502.17434v1  [cs.RO]  24 Feb 2025\n\nV-HOP: Visuo-Haptic 6D Object Pose Tracking\nDrawing inspiration from these human capabilities,\nresearchers have explored the integration of vision\nand touch in robotics for decades. As early as 1988,\nAllen (1988) proposed an object recognition system\nthat combined these modalities. More recently, data-\ndriven approaches have emerged to tackle object pose\nestimation using visuo-tactile information (Li et al.,\n2023; Suresh et al., 2024; Dikhale et al., 2022; Wan\net al., 2024; Rezazadeh et al., 2023; Tu et al., 2023;\nGao et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024b). Although promis-\ning, these methods face two major barriers that hinder\ntheir broader applicability: (i) Cross-embodiment:\nMost approaches overfit specific grippers or tactile\nsensor layouts, limiting their adaptability. (ii) Do-\nmain generalization: Compared to visual-only base-\nlines, visuo-tactile approaches struggle to generalize,\nhindered by insufficient data diversity and model scal-\nability. Moreover, they typically process each frame\nindependently, which can result in less coherent ob-\nject pose tracking over sequences in real-world de-\nployments. As a result, existing methods are challeng-\ning to deploy broadly and often require significant\ncustomization to specific robotic platforms.\nTo address these challenges, we propose V-HOP\n(Fig. 1): a two-fold solution for generalizable visuo-\nhaptic 6D object pose tracking. First, we introduce\na novel unified haptic representation that facilitates\ncross-embodiment learning. We consider the com-\nbination of tactile and kinesthesis in the form of a\npoint cloud, addressing a critical yet often overlooked\naspect of visuo-haptic learning. Second, we propose\na transformer-based object pose tracker to fuse visual\nand haptic features. We leverage the robust visual\nprior captured by the visual foundation model while\nincorporating haptics. V-HOP accommodates diverse\ngripper embodiments and various objects and gener-\nalizes to novel embodiments and objects.\nWe build a multi-embodied dataset with eight\ngrippers using the NVIDIA Isaac Sim simulator for\ntraining and evaluation. Compared to Foundation-\nPose (Wen et al., 2024), our approach achieves 5% im-\nprovement in the accuracy of object pose estimation\nin terms of ADD-S (Xiang et al., 2018) in our dataset.\nThese results highlight the benefit of fusing visual and\nhaptic sensing. In the FeelSight dataset (Suresh et al.,\n2024), we benchmark against NeuralFeels (Suresh\net al., 2024), an optimization-based visuo-tactile ob-\nject pose tracker, achieving a 32% improvement in\nthe ADD-S metric and ten times faster run-time speed.\nFinally, we perform the sim-to-real transfer experi-\nments using Barrett Hands. Our method demonstrates\nremarkable robustness and significantly outperforms\nFoundationPose, which could lose object tracks en-\ntirely (Fig. 5). When integrated into motion plans,\nour approach achieves 40% higher average task suc-\ncess rates. To the best of our knowledge, V-HOP is\nthe first data-driven visuo-haptic approach to demon-\nstrate robust generalization across both taxel-based\ntactile sensors (e.g., Barrett Hand) and vision-based\ntactile sensors (e.g., DIGIT sensors), as well as on\nnovel embodiments and objects.\nIn conclusion, our contributions to this paper are\ntwo-fold:\n1. Unified haptic representation: we introduce\na novel haptic representation, enabling cross-\nembodiment learning and addressing the cross-\nembodiment challenge by improving adaptabil-\nity across diverse embodiments and objects.\n2. Visuo-haptic transformer: We present a trans-\nformer model that integrates visual and hap-\ntic data, improving pose tracking consistency\nand addressing the domain generalization chal-\nlenge.\n2. Background\nIn this section, we first define the problem formally\nand then review existing haptic representations and\nour proposed unified representation.\n2.1. Problem Definition\nWe tackle the model-based visuo-haptic 6D object\npose tracking problem, assuming access to:\n• Visual observations: An RGB-D sensor observes\nthe object in the environment.\n• Haptic feedback: The object is manipulated by\na rigid gripper equipped with tactile sensors.\nOur approach takes the following as input:\n1. The CAD model 𝑜of the object.\n2. A sequence of RGB-D images = {𝐎𝑖}𝑡\n𝑖=1,\nwhere each observation 𝐎𝑖= [𝐈𝑖, 𝐃𝑖] includes\nan RGB image 𝐈𝑖and a depth map 𝐃𝑖.\n3. An initial 6D pose 𝐓0 = (𝐑0, 𝐭0) ∈SE(3), where\n𝐑0 ∈SO(3) is 3D rotation and 𝐭0 ∈ℝ3 is 3D\ntranslation.\nIn practice, the ground-truth initial pose 𝐓0 is hard\nto obtain and can only be estimated through pose\nestimation (Xiang et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019a;\n2\n\nV-HOP: Visuo-Haptic 6D Object Pose Tracking\nPark et al., 2019; Li et al., 2024c; Wang et al., 2019b;\nLee et al., 2023; Wen et al., 2024; Labbé et al., 2022;\nHe et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2024a;\nTremblay et al., 2018; Wen et al., 2020b). Therefore,\nwe treat ̂𝐓0 = 𝐓0 in the following. At each timestep 𝑖,\nour model estimates the object pose ̂𝐓𝑖given all the\ninputs with the initial pose being the estimate ̂𝐓𝑖−1 at\nthe previous timestep.\nThe above inputs are the standard inputs from the\nmodel-based visual pose tracking problem (Wen et al.,\n2020a; Deng et al., 2021), while the inputs below will\nserve our haptic representation and will be detailed\nin later sections.\n4.

Tactile sensor data , including Positions 𝑝\nand readings 𝑟of tactile sensors, which will be\nformally defined in the next section.\n7. Transformation between the camera and the\nrobot frames obtained through hand-eye cali-\nbration (Marchand et al., 2005).\n2.2. Haptic Representation\nThe effectiveness of haptic learning hinges on its rep-\nresentation. Prior approaches using raw value (Lin\net al., 2024b), image (Guzey et al., 2023), or graph-\nbased (Yang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024b; Rezazadeh\net al., 2023) representations often struggle to gener-\nalize across diverse embodiments. For instance, Wu\net al. (2022) and Guzey et al. (2023) project tactile\nsignals from Xela sensors into a 2D image format.\nWhile this allows efficient processing with existing\nvisual models, extending the method to different grip-\npers or sensor layouts proves challenging. Similarly,\nLi et al. (2024b) and Rezazadeh et al. (2023) employ\ngraph-based mappings, where taxels are represented\nas vertices. However, variations in sensor layouts\nresult in different graph distributions, creating signifi-\ncant generalization gaps.\nIn contrast, we adopt a point cloud representation,\nwhich naturally encode 3D positions and can flexibly\naccommodate multi-embodiments. We broadly clas-\nsify tactile sensors into taxel-based and vision-based.\nA more comprehensive review on tactile sensors can\nbe found at (Yamaguchi and Atkeson, 2019). Below,\nwe outline how they are converted into point clouds\nin prior works (Dikhale et al., 2022; Suresh et al.,\n2024; Watkins-Valls et al., 2019; Falco et al., 2017),\npaving the way for our unified framework.\nTaxel-based Sensors. The tactile data is defined as\n= {𝑠𝑖}𝑛𝑡\n𝑖=1, which encapsulate 𝑛𝑡taxels. 𝑠𝑖represents\nindividual taxels. The tactile data consists of =\n(𝑝, 𝑟):\n• Positions (𝑝): Defined in the gripper frame\nand transformed into the camera frame using\nforward kinematics.\n• Readings (𝑟): Capturing contact values. Read-\nings are commonly binarized into contact or no-\ncontact states (Yin et al., 2023; Xue et al., 2023;\nLi et al., 2023; Dikhale et al., 2022) based on a\nthreshold 𝜏.\nThe set of taxels in contact is:\n𝑐= {𝑠𝑖∈∣𝑟(𝑠𝑖) > 𝜏},\n(1)\nand the corresponding tactile point cloud 𝑝,𝑐is de-\nfined as\n𝑝,𝑐= {𝑝(𝑠𝑖) ∣𝑠𝑖∈𝑐}.\n(2)\nVision-based sensors. For vision-based tactile\nsensors (Lambeta et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2017; Don-\nlon et al., 2018; Taylor et al., 2022), the tactile data\nincludes = (𝑝, 𝐼):\n• Positions (𝑝): Sensor positions in the camera\nframe, similar to taxel-based.\n• Images (𝐼): Capturing contact states using reg-\nular RGB image representation. Using the tac-\ntile depth estimation model (Bauza et al., 2019;\nSuresh et al., 2024; Kuppuswamy et al., 2020;\nSuresh et al., 2023; 2022; Ambrus et al., 2021),\nwe can convert 𝐼into tactile point cloud 𝑝,𝑐.\nYet we are not the first to employ point cloud rep-\nresentations for tactile learning, prior works (Dikhale\net al., 2022; Suresh et al., 2024; Watkins-Valls et al.,\n2019; Falco et al., 2017) focus on a single type\nof sensor and overlook the hand posture. Our key\ncontribution is a unified representation spanning\nboth taxel-based and vision-based sensors on multi-\nembodiments, empowered by our multi-embodied\ndataset. We demonstrate generalizability on the Bar-\nrett hand (taxel-based) during our real-world experi-\nments and on the Allegro hand (vision-based DIGIT\nsensor) using the Feelsight dataset (Suresh et al.,\n2024). Our novel haptic representation seamlessly\nintegrates the tactile signals with the hand posture,\nenabling more effective hand-object interaction rea-\nsoning. In subsequent sections, we describe our ap-\nproach and provide empirical evidence demonstrating\n3\n\nV-HOP: Visuo-Haptic 6D Object Pose Tracking\nthat our representation improves generalization ca-\npabilities, bridging the gap between heterogeneous\ntactile sensor modalities.\n3. Methodology\nWe propose V-HOP, a data-driven approach that fuses\nvisual and haptic modalities to achieve accurate 6D\nobject pose tracking. Our goal is to build a general-\nizable visuo-haptic pose tracker that accommodates\ndiverse embodiments and objects. We first outline\nthe core representations used in our haptic modality:\nhand and object representations. Our choice for the\nrepresentations follows the spirit of the render-and-\ncompare paradigm (Li et al., 2018). Later, we intro-\nduce our visuo-haptic model and how it is trained. We\nuse the terms “hand” and “gripper” interchangeably.\n3.1. Hand Representation\nTactile signals only represent the cutaneous stimula-\ntion, while haptic sensing combines tactile and kines-\nthetic feedback to provide a more comprehensive spa-\ntial understanding of contact and manipulation. We\npropose a novel haptic representation that integrates\ntactile signals and hand posture in a unified point\ncloud representation. This hand-centric representa-\ntion enables efficient reasoning about spatial contact\nand hand-object interaction.\nUsing the URDF definition and joint positions 𝐣,\nwe generate the hand mesh ℎthrough forward kine-\nmatics and calculate the surface normals. The mesh\nis then downsampled to produce a 9-D hand point\ncloud ℎ= {𝐩𝑖}𝑛ℎ\n𝑖=1:\n𝐩𝑖= (𝑥𝑖, 𝑦𝑖, 𝑧𝑖, 𝑛𝑖𝑥, 𝑛𝑖𝑦, 𝑛𝑖𝑧, 𝐜) ∈ℝ9,\n(3)\nwhere 𝑥𝑖, 𝑦𝑖, 𝑧𝑖represent the 3-D coordinate of the\npoint. 𝑛𝑖𝑥, 𝑛𝑖𝑦, 𝑛𝑖𝑧represent the 3-D normal vectors,\nand 𝐜∈ℝ3 is a one-hot encoded point label:\n• [1, 0, 0]: Hand point in contact.\n• [0, 1, 0]: Hand point not in contact.\n• [0, 0, 1]: Object point (for later integration with\nthe object point cloud).\nTo obtain the contact state of each point, we map\nthe tactile point cloud 𝑝,𝑐, representing the contact\npoints detected by the tactile sensors (Sec. 2.2), onto\nthe downsampled hand point cloud ℎ. Specifically,\nfor each point in 𝑝,𝑐, we find its neighboring points\nin ℎwithin a radius 𝑟. These neighboring points are\nlabeled as “in contact”, while all others are labeled\nas “not in contact”. The choice of the radius 𝑟is\nrandomized during training and determined by the\nmeasured effective radius of each taxel during robot\ndeployment. The resulting haptic point cloud, ℎ,\nserves as a unified representation for both tactile and\nkinesthetic data (Fig. 2).\n3.2. Object Representation\nWe denote the object model point cloud as Φ =\n{𝐪𝑖}𝑛𝑜\n𝑖=1. Similar to the hand point cloud, 𝐪𝑖follows the\nsame 9-D definitions (Equation 3),\n𝐪𝑖= (𝑥𝑖, 𝑦𝑖, 𝑧𝑖, 𝑛𝑖𝑥, 𝑛𝑖𝑦, 𝑛𝑖𝑧, 𝐜) ∈ℝ9,\nwith 𝐜= [0, 0, 1] for all object points.\nAt each\ntimestep 𝑖> 0, we transform the model point cloud\ninto a hypothesized point cloud 𝑜= {𝐪′\n𝑖}𝑛𝑜\n𝑖=1 accord-\ning to the pose from the previous timestep 𝐓𝑖−1. For\neach point 𝐪′\n𝑖in the hypothesized point cloud 𝑜\n𝐪′\n𝑖= (𝑥′\n𝑖, 𝑦′\n𝑖, 𝑧′\n𝑖, 𝑛′\n𝑖𝑥, 𝑛′\n𝑖𝑦, 𝑛′\n𝑖𝑧, 𝐜),\n(4)\nwhere:\n⎡\n⎢\n⎢\n⎣\n𝑥′\n𝑖\n𝑦′\n𝑖\n𝑧′\n𝑖\n⎤\n⎥\n⎥\n⎦\n= 𝐑𝑖−1\n⎡\n⎢\n⎢\n⎣\n𝑥𝑖\n𝑦𝑖\n𝑧𝑖\n⎤\n⎥\n⎥\n⎦\n+ 𝐭𝑖−1,\n⎡\n⎢\n⎢\n⎣\n𝑛′\n𝑖𝑥\n𝑛′\n𝑖𝑦\n𝑛′\n𝑖𝑧\n⎤\n⎥\n⎥\n⎦\n= 𝐑𝑖−1\n⎡\n⎢\n⎢\n⎣\n𝑛𝑖𝑥\n𝑛𝑖𝑦\n𝑛𝑖𝑧\n⎤\n⎥\n⎥\n⎦\n.\n(5)\nTo enable reasoning about hand-object interactions,\nwe fuse the hand point cloud ℎand the hypothesized\nobject point cloud 𝑜to create a hand-object point\ncloud ,\n= ℎ∪𝑜.\n(6)\nThis novel unified representation adopts the princi-\nples of the render-and-compare paradigm from vi-\nsual approaches (Li et al., 2018; Wen et al., 2020a;\nLabbé et al., 2022; Wen et al., 2024; Tremblay et al.,\n2023), in which the rendered image (based on pose\nhypothesis) is compared against the visual observa-\ntion. The hypothesized object point cloud 𝑜serves\nas the “rendered” pose hypothesis (Fig. 2). The hand\npoint cloud ℎrepresents the real observation using\nhaptic feedback, which we used to compare with. By\nleveraging this representation, the model captures the\ncontact-rich interactions between the hand and the\nobject by learning feasible object poses informed by\nhaptic feedback.\n3.3. Network Design\nVisual modality. Unlike prior works, which train\nthe whole visuo-haptic network from scratch, our ap-\nproach can effectively leverage the pretrained visual\n4\n\nV-HOP: Visuo-Haptic 6D Object Pose Tracking\nVisual\nEncoder\nVisual\nEncoder\nResBlock\nTranslation\nEncoder\nRotation\nEncoder\nLinear\nLinear\n3D Rotation\n3D Translation\nPositional\nEncoding\nHaptic\nEncoder\nHxWxC\nHxWxC\nHxWx2C\nShared   Weights\nHaptic\nVisual\n6D Pose\nFigure 2: Network design of V-HOP. The visual modality, based on FoundationPose (Wen et al., 2024), uses a\nvisual encoder to process RGB-D observations (real and rendered) into feature maps, which are concatenated and\nrefined through a ResBlock to produce visual embeddings (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). The haptic modality encodes a\nunified hand-object point cloud, derived from 9D hand ℎand object 𝑜point clouds, into a haptic embedding that\ncaptures hand-object interactions. The red dot in the figure denotes the activated tactile sensor. These visual and haptic\nembeddings are processed by Transformer encoders to estimate 3D translation and rotation.\nfoundation model. Our design extends the formu-\nlation of FoundationPose (Wen et al., 2024), as it\ndemonstrates great generalizability on unseen objects\nand a narrow sim-to-real gap. To harness the high-\nquality visual prior captured by it, we utilize its visual\nencoder 𝑓𝑣and freeze it during our training. Using\nthis encoder, We transform the RGB-D observation\ninto visual embeddings 𝐙𝑣= 𝑓𝑣(𝐎).\nHaptic modality. In parallel, we encode the hand-\nobject point cloud using a haptic encoder 𝑓ℎ, result-\ning in a haptic embedding 𝐙ℎ= 𝑓ℎ(). By represent-\ning all interactions in point cloud space, our novel\nhaptic representation provides the flexibility to utilize\nany point cloud-based network for encoding. For this\npurpose, we choose PointNet++ (Qi et al., 2017) as\nour haptic encoder 𝑓ℎ. To improve learning efficiency,\nwe canonicalize the point cloud using the centroid\nof the hand points, ensuring is spatially centered\naround the gripper during processing.\nVisuo-haptic fusion. Integrating visual and hap-\ntic modalities, however, poses significant challenges.\nExisting methods often apply fixed or biased weight-\nings between these modalities (Li et al., 2023; Suresh\net al., 2024; Dikhale et al., 2022; Tu et al., 2023),\nwhich can fail under specific conditions. For exam-\nple, when contact is absent, the visual modality alone\nshould be leveraged, or when occlusion is severe, hap-\ntics should be favored. Inspired by the principle of\n“optimal integration” in human multisensory percep-\ntion (Ernst and Banks, 2002; Helbig and Ernst, 2007;\nLacey and Sathian, 2020; Takahashi and Watt, 2014;\nHelbig et al., 2012), where the brain dynamically\nadjusts the weighting of visual and haptic inputs to\nmaximize reliability, we adopt self-attention mecha-\nnisms (Vaswani et al., 2017) for the adaptive fusion\nof visual and haptic embeddings. This ensures robust-\nness across varying scenarios, whether the object is\nin contact or in clear view.\nTo achieve this fusion,\nwe propose haptic\ninstruction-tuning, inspired by visual instruction-\ntuning (Liu et al., 2023). While keeping the visual\nencoder 𝑓𝑣frozen, we feed both visual embedding 𝐙𝑣\nand haptic embedding 𝐙ℎinto the original visual-only\nTransformer encoders (Vaswani et al., 2017; Wen\net al., 2024), which are initialized with the pretrained\nweights from FoundationPose. We then fine-tune the\nTransformer encoders and the haptic encoder 𝑓ℎto-\ngether. Consequently, visual and haptic information\nis fused adaptively using self-attention blocks, and\nthe model dynamically adjusts the modality weight\nbased on the context (Fig. 9). Following Foundation-\nPose, we disentangle the 6D pose into 3D translation\nand 3D rotation and estimate them using two output\nheads (Fig. 2), respectively.\n3.4. Training Paradigm\nWe train our model by adding noise (𝐑𝜖, 𝐭𝜖) to the\nground-truth pose 𝐓= (𝐑, 𝐭) to create the hypothesis\npose ̃𝐓= (̃𝐑,̃𝐭):\ñ𝐑= 𝐑−1\n𝜖⋅𝐑,\ñ𝐭= −𝐭𝜖+ 𝐭.\n(7)\n5\n\nV-HOP: Visuo-Haptic 6D Object Pose Tracking\nFigure 3: Dataset sample visualization. (Top row) Barrett Hand, Shadow Hand, Allegro Hand, SHUNK SVH. (Bottom\nrow) D’Claw, LEAP Hand, Inspire Hand, Robotiq 3-Finger gripper.\nThe rendered image is generated using ̃𝐓, while the\nobject point hand is transformed based on ̃𝐓; in con-\ntrast, the RGB-D image and hand point cloud rep-\nresent actual observations. The model estimates the\nrelative pose Δ̂𝐓= (Δ̂𝐑, Δ̂𝐭) between the pose hypoth-\nesis and observation. The model is optimized using\nthe 𝐿2 loss:\n𝐓= ‖Δ̂𝐑−𝐑𝜖‖2 + ‖Δ̂𝐭−𝐭𝜖‖2,\n(8)\nwhere we use quaternion representations for rotations.\nThe estimated pose ̂𝐓= (̂𝐑,̂𝐭) is:\n̂𝐑= Δ̂𝐑⋅̃𝐑,\n̂𝐭= Δ̂𝐭+̃𝐭.\n(9)\nWe further incorporate an attractive loss (𝑎) and\na penetration loss (𝑝) to encourage the object to\nmake contact with the tactile point cloud 𝑝,𝑐and\navoid penetrating the hand point cloud ℎ. We first\ntransform the initial hypothesized object pose cloud\n𝑜using the estimated pose ̂𝑜= ̂𝐓̃𝐓−1 𝑜, where\n𝑜is in homogenous form.\nThe attractive loss enforces that each activated\ntaxel must make contact with the object:\n𝑎=\n1\n|𝑝,𝑐|\n∑\n𝑠𝑝,𝑐∈𝑝,𝑐\nmin\n𝑝∈̂𝑜\n‖𝑠𝑝,𝑐−𝑝‖2,\n(10)\nwhich can be interpreted as a single-direction Cham-\nfer distance between the tactile point cloud and the\nobject point cloud.\nThe penetration loss avoids penetrations between\nthe object and the gripper (Yang et al., 2021; 2024;\nBrahmbhatt et al., 2019):\n𝐩𝑜= arg min\n𝐪∈̂𝑜\n‖𝐪−𝐩ℎ‖2,\n𝑝= ∑\n𝐩ℎ∈ℎ\n𝑒max{0, −𝐧𝑜⋅(𝐩ℎ−𝐩𝑜)} −1,\n(11)\nwhere 𝐩𝑜represents the nearest neighbor of each point\n𝐩ℎin the hand point cloud ℎ. Our overall loss is:\n= 𝐓+ 𝛼𝑎+ 𝛽𝑝,\n(12)\nwhere we set 𝛼= 1 and 𝛽= 0.001 empirically. We\noptimize the model using the AdamW (Loshchilov\nand Hutter, 2018) optimizer with an initial learning\nrate of 0.0004 and train the model for 20 epochs.\n4. Experiments\n4.1. Multi-embodied Dataset\nExisting visuo-haptic datasets were not publicly avail-\nable (Dikhale et al., 2022; Li et al., 2024b; Wan\net al., 2024) at the time of completing this work\nand focused on a single gripper (Suresh et al., 2024),\nleaving the question of generalization to novel em-\nbodiments unanswered. Consequently, we develop\na multi-embodied dataset (Fig. 3) using NVIDIA\nIsaac Sim to enable cross-embodiment learning and\nthorough evaluation.

Pose Tracking Comparison\nIn the following experiments, we evaluate perfor-\nmance using the metrics:\n• Area under the curve (AUC) of ADD and ADD-\nS (Hinterstoisser et al., 2013; Xiang et al., 2018),\nand\n• ADD(-S)-0.1d (He et al., 2022): ADD/ADD-S\nthat is less than 10% of the object diameter.\nWe compare V-HOP against the current state-of-\nthe-art approaches in visual pose tracking (Founda-\ntionPose (Wen et al., 2024), or FP in short) and visuo-\ntactile pose estimation (ViTa (Dikhale et al., 2022)).\nTo ensure a fair comparison, we finetune Foundation-\nPose and train ViTa on our multi-embodied dataset.\nTo verify the generalizability of the novel object and\nnovel gripper, we exclude one object (pudding_box)\nand one gripper (D’Claw) during training.\nDue to the absence of a visuo-haptic pose tracking\napproach, we compare V-HOP with ViTa, an instance-\nHand Name\nAUC Metric\nViTa\nFP\nV-HOP\nADD\n24.48\n74.45\n76.20\nAllegro Hand\nADD-S\n77.60\n88.74\n90.48\nADD\n24.63\n77.67\n79.06\nBarrett Hand\nADD-S\n77.74\n88.72\n91.73\nADD\n21.99\n48.16\n57.49\nD’Claw (Unseen)\nADD-S\n76.00\n77.06\n85.48\nADD\n24.56\n70.22\n70.15\nInspire Hand\nADD-S\n77.65\n84.22\n87.28\nADD\n23.88\n64.17\n69.96\nLEAP Hand\nADD-S\n77.55\n83.06\n88.05\nADD\n23.40\n79.48\n79.14\nRobotiq 3-Finger\nADD-S\n76.87\n89.39\n90.61\nADD\n24.40\n61.01\n62.75\nSCHUNK SVH\nADD-S\n76.74\n78.58\n82.96\nADD\n23.81\n58.77\n60.27\nShadow Hand\nADD-S\n75.55\n73.24\n79.35\nADD ↑\n23.93\n66.29\n68.90\nAll\nADD-S ↑\n76.87\n82.37\n86.62\nTable 2: Per-gripper comparison of AUC metrics for\nADD and ADD-S.

For ViTa, we provide\nground-truth segmentation and train a separate model\nfor each object, as it is an instance-level method.\nIn contrast, both FoundationPose and V-HOP han-\ndle novel-object estimation and require training only\nonce. For fair evaluation, we run both methods for\ntwo iterations per tracking step. For V-HOP, we run\none visuo-haptic iteration and one visual iteration.\nIn Tab. 1, we show the performance for each object.\nV-HOP consistently outperforms ViTa and Founda-\ntionPose (FP) on most objects with respect to ADD\nand across all objects in terms of ADD-S. On aver-\nage, our approach delivers an improvement of 4% in\nADD and 5% in ADD-S compared to Foundation-\nPose. Notably, V-HOP demonstrates strong perfor-\nmance on unseen objects, highlighting the potential\nof our model to generalize effectively to novel ob-\njects.\nSimilarly, Tab. 2 illustrates the performance of\neach gripper. In line with its object performance,\nV-HOP outperforms its counterparts on most grippers\nin terms of ADD and across all grippers in ADD-S.\nMoreover, V-HOP demonstrates robust performance\non unseen grippers, further emphasizing the general-\nizability of our unified haptic representation.\n7\n\nV-HOP: Visuo-Haptic 6D Object Pose Tracking\nMethod\nAUC ADD\nADD-0.1d\nAUC ADD-S\nADD-S-0.1d\nWithout Tactile\n60.10\n43.69\n77.33\n63.17\nWithout Visual\n32.19\n3.72\n58.85\n31.44\nV-HOP (Ours)\n68.90\n48.55\n86.62\n77.83\nTable 3: Ablations of input modalities.

Ablation on Modalities\nWe conduct an ablation study on the input modalities\nto evaluate the effectiveness of the haptic represen-\ntation. Specifically, we train two ablated versions\nof V-HOP: one without tactile feedback and another\nwithout visual input, as shown in Tab. 3. To exclude\ntactile input, we remove all “in contact” point labels\n(Equation 3). Our results indicate that visual input\nsignificantly contributes to performance, likely due to\nthe richness of visual information, including texture\nand spatial details. This finding aligns with previous\nstudies on human perception systems, which suggest\nthat vision plays a dominant role in visuo-haptic in-\ntegration (Kassuba et al., 2013). Similarly, tactile\nfeedback is crucial; without it, performance degrades\nnotably because reasoning about hand-object contact\nduring interactions becomes more difficult.\n4.4. Occlusion’s Effect on the Performance\nWe evaluate the performance of V-HOP and Founda-\ntionPose across varying occlusion ratios (Fig. 4). The\nocclusion ratio is defined as the proportion of pixels\nin the segmentation mask relative to the total pixels\nin the rendered object image, generated using the\nground-truth pose. Our results show that V-HOP con-\nsistently outperforms FoundationPose in both ADD\nand ADD-S metrics under different levels of occlu-\nsion. These results underscore the importance of\nintegrating visual and haptic information to improve\nperformance in challenging occlusion scenarios.\nMethod\nGT Seg\nADD-S ↓\nADD-S-0.1d ↑\nFPS ↑\nNeuralFeels (Suresh et al., 2024)\n✓\n2.14\n98.95\n3\nV-HOP (Ours)\n✗\n1.46\n98.45\n32\nTable 4: Performance on the FeelSight Dataset. For\nconsistency with the metric used in NeuralFeels (Suresh\net al., 2024), this experiment reports the direct ADD-S\nmetric (Xiang et al., 2018) (in mm) rather than the AUC\nof ADD-S used in other experiments.\n4.5. Pose Tracking on FeelSight\nTo evaluate the generalizability of V-HOP, we bench-\nmark it against NeuralFeels (Suresh et al., 2024), a\nrecently introduced optimization-based visuo-tactile\npose tracking approach, using their proposed Feel-\nsight dataset. Specifically, we focus on the occlusion\nsubset of the dataset, FeelSight-Occlusion,\nwhich presents significant challenges due to severe\nocclusions. This subset requires robust generaliza-\ntion capabilities as it includes a novel embodiment\n(the Allegro hand equipped with DIGIT fingertips), a\nnovel sensor type (a vision-based tactile sensor), and\na novel object (a Rubik’s cube). For a fair compari-\nson, we compare against their model-based tracking\napproach, which uses almost the same inputs as V-\nHOP but with the ground-truth segmentation mask\n(GT Seg).\nThe results are presented in Tab. 4.\nV-HOP\nachieves a 32% lower ADD-S error compared to\nNeuralFeels and has a similar ADD-S-0.1d score.\nIt is important to note that NeuralFeels leverages\nthe ground-truth segmentation mask, which helps in\nmore accurate object localization, whereas V-HOP\ndoes not have such an input, further underscoring its\nrobustness and adaptability.\nIn terms of computational efficiency, V-HOP is ap-\nproximately 10 times faster than NeuralFeels, achiev-\ning 32 FPS compared to NeuralFeels’ 3 FPS on an\nNVIDIA RTX 4070 GPU. This substantial improve-\nment in speed highlights the practicality of V-HOP\nfor real-world manipulation applications, as we will\ndemonstrate in the later sections.\n5. Sim-to-Real Transfer Experiments\nTo validate the real-world effectiveness of our ap-\nproach, we perform sim-to-real experiments using\nour robot platform (Fig. 1). Our bimanual platform\ncomprises dual Franka Research 3 robotic arms (Had-\ndadin et al., 2022) and Barrett Hands BH8-282. Our\nBarrett Hand has 4 degrees of freedom (DoF) and 96\ntaxels: 24 taxels on each fingertip and 24 taxels on the\n8\n\nV-HOP: Visuo-Haptic 6D Object Pose Tracking\nFP\nV-HOP\nFP\nV-HOP\nFigure 5: Qualitative results of pose tracking sequences.

Each taxel comprises a capacitive cell capable\nof detecting forces within a range of 10 N/cm2 with a\nresolution of 0.01 N. For egocentric visual input, we\nuse a MultiSense SLB RGB-D camera, which com-\nbines a MultiSense S7 stereo camera and a Hokuyo\nUTM-30LX-EW laser scanner. We utilize Founda-\ntionPose to provide the initial frame pose estimate\nand CNOS (Nguyen et al., 2023; Kirillov et al., 2023)\nto provide the segmentation task.\n5.1. Pose Tracking Experiments\nIn this experiment (Fig. 5), the gripper stably grasps\nthe object while a human operator guides the robot\narm along a random trajectory. This introduces heavy\nocclusion and high dynamic motion to emulate chal-\nlenging real-world manipulation scenarios. Under\nthese conditions, FoundationPose often loses track-\ning due to reliance on visual input alone. In contrast,\nV-HOP maintains stable object tracking throughout\nthe trajectory, demonstrating the robustness of its\nvisuo-haptic sensing.\n5.2. Bimanual Handover Experiment\nIn this experiment (Fig. 6), an object is placed on a\ntable within reach of the robot’s right arm. The task\nMethod\nSugar Box\nPower Drill\nTomato Can\nAverage\nFP\n60\n40\n20\n40\nV-HOP\n80\n80\n80\n80\nTable 5: Success rate on bimanual handover task.\nrequires the robot to perform the following sequence\nof actions:\n1. Use the right arm to grasp the object and trans-\nport it to the center.\n2. Use the left arm to grasp the object from the\nright hand and place it into a designated bin.\nThe robot employs model-based grasping, which de-\npends on real-time object pose estimation. This task\npresents two key challenges:\n1. If the grasp attempt fails, the robot must detect\nthe failure based on the real-time object pose\nand reattempt the grasp.\n2. During transport to the center, the robot must\nmaintain precise tracking of the object’s pose to\nensure that the left arm can accurately grasp it.\nInaccurate tracking results could lead to colli-\nsion during the handover.\n9\n\nV-HOP: Visuo-Haptic 6D Object Pose Tracking\nFigure 6: Bimanual handover experiment. In this experiment, the robot performs bimanual manipulation to transport\nthe target object to the box. V-HOP integrates visual and haptic inputs to accurately track the pose of the in-hand object\nin real-time, resulting in stable handover performance. Results on more objects can be found in the appendix.\nFigure 7: Robustness test for the bimanual handover\ntask. (Left) The object is placed at various randomized\npositions. (Right) A human perturbs the object by moving\nit to a different position while the robot attempts to grasp\nit.\nMethod\nCan-in-Mug\nBimanual Can-in-Mug\nFP\n20\n0\nV-HOP\n60\n20\nTable 6: Success rate on Can-in-Mug task.\nV-HOP enables the motion planner to handle ob-\njects in random positions and adapt to dynamic sce-\nnarios, such as human perturbations. For instance, a\nhuman may move the object during task execution,\nremove it from the gripper, or reposition it on the ta-\nble (Fig. 7). Due to the integration of haptic feedback,\nV-HOP accurately tracks the object’s pose, allowing\nthe robot to promptly detect and respond to changes,\nsuch as the object leaving the gripper. On the con-\ntrary, FoundationPose loses tracking during handover\nor grasping failure (Fig. 6) and leads to collisions. In\nTab. 5, we show the success rate for each object for\nfive trials. V-HOP has 40% higher success rate on\naverage compared to FoundationPose.\n5.3. Can-in-Mug Experiment\nThe Can-in-Mug task (Fig. 8) involves grasping a\ntomato can and inserting it into a mug. The biman-\n(a) Can-in-Mug task.\n(b) Bimanual Can-in-Mug task.\nFigure 8: Can-in-Mug tasks. (top) The robot grasps the\ncan and inserts it into the mug. (bottom) The robot uses\nbimanual to grasp the can and the mug and insert the can\ninto the mug in the center.\nual version requires the robot to also grasp the mug\nand insert the can in the center. Successful execution\nhinges on precise pose estimation for both objects, as\nany noise in their poses can lead to failure. Our re-\nsults (Tab. 6) demonstrate that V-HOP, by integrating\nvisual and haptic inputs, delivers more stable tracking\nand a higher overall success rate.\n5.4. Contribution of each modality\nIn this study, we examine the contribution of visual\nand haptic inputs to the final prediction. We adapt\nGrad-CAM (Selvaraju et al., 2020), utilizing the fi-\nnal normalization layer of the Transformer encoder\nas the target layer. Figure 9 illustrates the weight\ndistribution across the visual and haptic modalities.\n10\n\nV-HOP: Visuo-Haptic 6D Object Pose Tracking\nFigure 9: Weights of visual and haptic modalities to\nthe final prediction. We overlay the modality weights\ncalculated using GradCAM (Selvaraju et al., 2020) in the\ntop-right corner.\nOur findings suggest that when the gripper is not\nin contact with an object, the model predominantly\nrelies on visual inputs. However, as the gripper es-\ntablishes contact and occlusion becomes more severe,\nthe model increasingly shifts its reliance toward hap-\ntic inputs. This finding confirms the choice of self-\nattention mechanism to emulate human’s “optimal\nintegration” principle.\n6. Related Works\nIn this work, we consider the problem of 6D object\npose tracking problem, which has been widely stud-\nied as a visual problem (Wen et al., 2020a; Li et al.,\n2018; Wen et al., 2024; Deng et al., 2021). In partic-\nular, we focus on model-based tracking approaches,\nwhich assume access to the object’s CAD model.\nWhile model-free approaches (Wen and Bekris, 2021;\nWen et al., 2023; Suresh et al., 2024) exist, they fall\noutside the scope of this work. Visual pose track-\ning has achieved significant progress on established\nbenchmarks, such as BOP (Hodan et al., 2024). De-\nspite these successes, deploying such systems in real-\nworld robotic applications remains challenging, es-\npecially under scenarios with high occlusion and\ndynamic interactions, such as in-hand manipulation\ntasks.\nTo address these challenges, prior research has ex-\nplored combining visual and tactile information to im-\nprove pose tracking robustness (Li et al., 2023; Suresh\net al., 2024; Dikhale et al., 2022; Wan et al., 2024;\nRezazadeh et al., 2023; Tu et al., 2023; Gao et al.,\n2023; Li et al., 2024b). These approaches leverage\nlearning-based techniques to estimate object poses\nby fusing visuo-tactile inputs. However, these meth-\nods estimate poses on a per-frame basis, which lacks\ntemporal coherence. Additionally, cross-embodiment\nand domain generalization remain significant hurdles,\nlimiting their scalability and practicality for broad\ndeployment.\nMore recent works aim to overcome some of\nthese limitations. For example, Liu et al. (2024)\nproposes an optimization-based approach that inte-\ngrates tactile data with visual pose tracking using\nan ad-hoc slippage detector and velocity predictor.\nSuresh et al. (2024) extend the model-free tracking\nframeworks BundleTrack (Wen and Bekris, 2021)\nand BundleSDF (Wen et al., 2023) by combining\nvisual and tactile point clouds within a pose graph\noptimization framework. However, these approaches\nare only validated on a single embodiment and suf-\nfer from computational inefficiencies (Suresh et al.,\n2024), which present challenges for real-time deploy-\nment in dynamic manipulation tasks.\n7. Limitation\nWe follow the model-based object pose tracking set-\nting, which assumes that a CAD model is available\nfor the object. One potential direction to overcome\nthis limitation is to simultaneously reconstruct the\nobject and perform pose tracking, as demonstrated in\nmethods like BundleSDF (Wen et al., 2023).\n8. Conclusion\nWe introduced V-HOP, a visuo-haptic 6D object pose\ntracker that integrates a unified haptic representation\nand a visuo-haptic transformer. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that V-HOP generalizes effectively to\nnovel sensor types, embodiments, and objects, out-\nperforming state-of-the-art visual and visuo-tactile\napproaches. Ablation studies highlight the critical\nrole of both visual and haptic modalities in the frame-\nwork. In the sim-to-real transfer experiments, V-HOP\nproved robust, delivering stable tracking under high\nocclusion and dynamic conditions. Furthermore, inte-\ngrating V-HOP’s real-time pose tracking into motion\nplanning enabled accurate manipulation tasks, such\nas bimanual handover and insertion, showcasing its\npractical effectiveness.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work is supported by the National Science Foun-\ndation (NSF) under CAREER grant #2143576, grant\n#2346528, and ONR Grant #N00014-22-1-259.
