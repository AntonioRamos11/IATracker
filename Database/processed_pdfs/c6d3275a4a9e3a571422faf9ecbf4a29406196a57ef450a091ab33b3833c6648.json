Xiamen Lijing New Energy Technology Co., Ltd., Xiamen, China \n \nSignificance Statement \nAs electric vehicles (EVs) approach the end of their operational life, their batteries retain significant \neconomic value and present promising opportunities for second-life use and material recycling. This \nis particularly compelling for Global South and other underdeveloped regions, where reliable energy \nstorage is vital to addressing critical challenges posed by weak and even nonexistent power grid and \nenergy infrastructures. However, despite this potential, widespread adoption has been hindered by \ncritical uncertainties surrounding the technical performance, safety, and recertification of second-\nlife batteries. In cases where they have been redeployed, mismatches between estimated and actual \nperformance often render batteries technically unsuitable or hazardous, turning them into liabilities \nfor communities they were intended to benefit. This considerable misalignment exacerbates energy \naccess disparities and undermines the broader vision of energy justice, highlighting an urgent need \nfor robust and scalable solutions to unlock the potential. In the PulseBat Dataset, the authors tested \n464 retired lithium-ion batteries, covering 3 cathode material types, 6 historical usages, 3 physical \nformats, and 6 capacity designs. The pulse test experiments were performed repeatedly for each \nsecond-life battery with 10 pulse width, 10 pulse magnitude, multiple state-of-charge, and state-of-\nhealth conditions, e.g., from 0.37 to 1.03 (larger than the nominal capacity due to manufacturing \ninconsistencies). The PulseBat Dataset recorded these test conditions and the voltage response as \nwell as the temperature signals that were subject to the injected pulse current, which could be used \nas a valuable data resource for critical diagnostics tasks such as state-of-charge estimation, state-of-\nhealth estimation, cathode material type identification, open-circuit voltage reconstruction, thermal \nmanagement, and beyond. Part of the PulseBat Dataset was used in Nature Communications \npublications that addressed the state-of-health estimation problem under randomly distributed state-\nof-charge conditions1.  \n \nCorrespondence \nXuan Zhang: xuanzhang@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn;Guangmin Zhou: guangminzhou@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn   \n\n1 \nOverview \nThe overview of second-life batteries tested is summarized below: \nBatch \nMaterial \nQ (Ah) \nFormat \nHistory \nQuantity \nState of health Range (Median, Std.) \n1 \nNMC \n2.1 \nCylinder \nAccelerated aging \n67 \n0.61-0.92 (0.83, 0.07) \n1 \nLMO \n10.0 \nPouch \nHEV1 \n95 \n0.51-0.95 (0.88, 0.11) \n1 \nNMC \n21.0 \nPouch \nBEV1 \n52 \n0.75-1.01 (0.99, 0.05) \n1 \nLFP \n35.0 \nPrismatic  HEV2 \n56 \n0.74-0.96 (0.85, 0.05) \n2 \nLMO \n25.0 \nPouch \nPHEV1 \n96 \n0.37-0.95 (0.80, 0.12) \n2 \nLMO \n26.0 \nPouch \nHEV3 \n98 \n0.78-1.03 (0.94, 0.07) \nwhere, NMC, LMO, and LFP stand for lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide, lithium \nmanganese oxide, and lithium iron phosphate, respectively. HEV, BEV, and PHEV stand \nfor hybrid, battery, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, respectively. Q stands for the \nnominal capacity rated by the manufacturer. State-of-health value can be larger than 1 due \nto inconsistencies from the manufacturing process. \n2 \nExperimental procedures \nTests were performed with BAT-NEEFLCT-05300-V010, NEBULA, Co, Ltd, and the air \nconditioner temperature was set at 25℃.  \n2.1 \nStep 1: Capacity Calibration \nWe use the widely adopted constant current (CC) discharge method as the gold standard \nfor determining the capacity of retired batteries. Even considering the different initial state \nof charge (SOC) distributions of retired batteries, we use a unified method of first constant \ncurrent constant voltage (CCCV) charging and then CC discharging to determine the \ncapacity of retired batteries.  \nFirst, the retired batteries are charged to the upper cut-off voltage using a 1C constant \ncurrent, then charged using constant voltage until the current drops to 0.05 C. The batteries \nare then discharged to the lower cut-off voltage using a 1C constant current. We use the \nactual discharge capacity as the calibrated (true) battery capacity and then let the battery \nrest for 20 minutes before SOC conditioning and pulse injection. The term C refers to the \nC-rate, determined by the current value required by a 1-hour full charge or discharge of a \nbattery. The sampling frequency during Step 1 is 1 Hz. The cut-off conditions of Step 1 \nare listed in the table below: \n\nBatch \nMaterial \nQ (Ah) \nFormat \nCut-off voltage for discharging/charging (V) \n1 \nNMC \n2.1 \nCylinder \n2.0/4.2 \n1 \nLMO \n10.0 \nPouch \n2.7/4.2 \n1 \nNMC \n21.0 \nPouch \n2.7/4.2 \n1 \nLFP \n35.0 \nPrismatic  \n2.5/3.65 \n2 \nLMO \n25.0 \nPouch \n2.7/4.2 \n2 \nLMO \n26.0 \nPouch \n2.7/4.2 \n \n2.2 \nStep 2: SOC Conditioning \nSOC conditioning refers to adjusting the battery SOC to a desired level. The battery is at \nits zero SOC when the capacity calibration is finished. When a 5% SOC is desired, we use \na 1C constant current for 3 minutes to adjust the calibrated battery to a 5% SOC level. The \nbattery is then left to stand for 10 minutes to rest, expecting the battery to return to a steady \nstate in preparation for subsequent pulse injection. Notice that SOC here is defined as the \nratio of charged or dischargeable capacity to the nominal capacity. The sampling frequency \nduring Step 2 is 1 Hz.  \n2.3 \nStep 3: Pulse Injection \nThe pulse width and pulse resting time are shown in the following table; that is, for each \npulse width and resting time (each row of the table), we consecutively perform pulse \ninjection with pulse amplitude being 0.5-1-1.5-2-2.5(C) in order, including positive and \nnegative pulse injections. Note that positive and negative pulses alternate to cancel the \nequivalent energy injection; thus, the stored energy inside the battery does not change. \nTake pulse injection at 5% SOC as an example; at the 30ms pulse width, we inject 0.5C \npositive current pulse, then let the battery rest for 450ms, and then inject 0.5C negative \ncurrent pulse, then again let the battery rest for 450ms. Still at 5% SOC, other remaining \npulses with other amplitudes follow the rest time of the previous pulses. Repetitive \nexperiments are performed until the remaining pulse widths are exhausted. Then, we \ncharge the retired battery with a constant current of 1C for another 3 minutes to 10% SOC \n(refer to Step 1 for details), followed by the same procedure as explained above. \n\nPulse width (ms) \nPulse rest time (ms) \nPulse magnitude (±C) \n30 \n450 \n0.5-1-1.5-2-2.5 \n50 \n750 \n70 \n1,050 \n100 \n1,500 \n300 \n4,500 \n500 \n7,500 \n700 \n10,500 \n1,000 \n15,000 \n3,000 \n45,000 \n5,000 \n75,000 \nRepeat Step 2 and Step 3 until the SOC conditioning region is exhausted. The sampling \nfrequency during Step 3 is 100 Hz. \n2.4 \nSOC Conditioning Range Determination \nThe range of SOC conditioning is determined by a calibrated SOH of the retired battery. \nSpecifically, the upper bound of the SOC conditioning region is lower than the calibrated \nminimal SOH value of the retired battery by 0.05. For instance, when the retired battery \nhas a previously calibrated SOH between 0.50 and 0.55, then the SOC conditioning region \nwill be 5% to 45%, with a grain of 5%.

If the security check is passed, no time will be made up for the already terminated \nwork step, but the remaining work steps in the test procedure will be continued. In our test, \nvoltage is mainly possible to exceed the protection range during charging, and no cases \nbelow the protection range during discharge have been found. The specific protection \nvoltage parameters are consistent with those in the following table. \nBatch \nMaterial \nQ (Ah) \nFormat \nCut-off voltage for discharging/charging (V) \n1 \nNMC \n2.1 \nCylinder \n1.95/4.3 \n1 \nLMO \n10.0 \nPouch \n2.65/4.25 \n1 \nNMC \n21.0 \nPouch \n2.65/4.3 \n1 \nLFP \n35.0 \nPrismatic  \n2.45/3.7 \n2 \nLMO \n25.0 \nPouch \n2.65/4.25 \n2 \nLMO \n26.0 \nPouch \n2.65/4.25 \n2.6 \nSOC Deviation \nThe unequal charged and discharged capacity in adjacent positive and negative pulses with \nthe same pulse intensity and planned pulse width caused by voltage protection will lead to \nan accumulative deviation in SOC to subsequent pulse tests. This SOC deviation is usually \nvery slight due to the extremely short pulse width with no more than 5s. The voltage may \nexceed the protection range when the tested SOC is close to the SOH value of the battery. \nIn Nature Communications publication1, we only used data from 5-50% SOC. Considering \nthat the SOH of the vast majority of batteries is above 0.6, the SOC deviation used can be \nignored for simplicity. However, if readers want to use data at a higher SOC level, they \nneed to pay attention to this SOC deviation issue to avoid introducing unnecessary errors. \n3 \nAccessibility \nThe raw data and the manipulation code are accessible at this link.
