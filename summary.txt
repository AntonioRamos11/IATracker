1. Data Collection: Scraping and Indexing AI Papers

You need to collect papers from multiple sources, primarily:

    arXiv: Use the arXiv API to fetch new AI papers.
    Papers With Code: Their API can help you track papers linked with implementations.
    Semantic Scholar: Offers a metadata API for research papers.
    ACL Anthology, NeurIPS, CVPR, ICLR, etc.: Many AI conferences publish proceedings online.
    Google Scholar (unofficially): Harder to scrape, but possible.

Tech Stack for Scraping: Python (requests, BeautifulSoup, arXiv API, Selenium for dynamic pages).
2. PDF Processing: Extracting Text from Papers

Once you have the paper PDFs, extract and preprocess the text:

    Parsing PDFs: PyMuPDF, pdfplumber, pdfminer.six
    Cleaning Text: Remove references, tables, equations
    OCR for Scanned PDFs: Tesseract

3. AI Summarization & Analysis

    Summarization Models:
        LLMs (GPT, Claude, LLaMA, Mistral, etc.) for extracting key insights.
        Extractive Summarization: BERTSUM, TextRank
        Abstractive Summarization: T5, PEGASUS, BART

    Keyword Extraction (spaCy, KeyBERT)

    Trend Detection: Compare paper topics over time, detect emerging trends in AI.

4. Tracking Changes in AI Research

    Compare papers over time: Identify how research topics evolve (e.g., trends in Transformers vs. Diffusion Models).
    Author Networks: Track influential researchers and their latest work.
    Citation Graphs: networkx, scipy

5. Building a Web App or Dashboard

    Backend: Python (Flask, FastAPI)
    Frontend: React, Next.js
    Database: PostgreSQL (metadata), Elasticsearch (full-text search)
    Visualization: Plotly, D3.js, Matplotlib
